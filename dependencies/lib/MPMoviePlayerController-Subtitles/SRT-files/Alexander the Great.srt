1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,504
(man) It is men who endure toil and dare
dangers that achieve glorious deeds.

2
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,798
And it is a lovely thing
to live with courage,

3
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,030
and to die leaving behind
an everlasting renown.

4
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,571
War!
This is what Demosthenes calls for, war!

5
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,699
(crowd protests)

6
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:21,391
- Aeschenes puts words in my mouth.
- If you mean truth, I put it there.

7
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,832
I know of no other way
for it to come from your mouth!

8
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,814
(crowd laughs)

9
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,107
Your audience performs well today.

10
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:33,800
Philip's money is well spent. The words
I used were "arms" and "money".

11
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,928
I quarrel with the words you did not use:
"Men" and "blood".

12
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:40,682
If these words must be used...
yes, men and blood.

13
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,558
Athenian men and Athenian blood?

14
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,852
To save Athens,
whose blood should be shed?

15
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:49,857
- (man) To save Athens, not Olynthus!
- And if Olynthus falls to the barbarian,

16
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,464
what stands between
Athens and destruction?

17
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,739
- Peace!
- Move for peace and I'll support you.

18
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,389
Men of Athens,
are there still madmen among you...?

19
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:05,081
Who wish to live?
I'm mad. I'm stark, raving mad.

20
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:14,778
Are there sane men among you
who still think that we have the power

21
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,698
to debate the question of war or peace?

22
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,409
Who will fight? You or us?

23
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,788
Why do you speak thus? For love
of country or love of Philip's gold?

24
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,021
No! No! No!

25
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:33,234
Philip has been at war with us ever since
he razed the first Greek city to the ground.

26
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:38,552
And as each Greek city fell,
Philip, too, kept proclaiming peace.

27
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:40,637
And, to our eternal shame,

28
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:45,225
we stood by and never once
cried out against his barbaric acts.

29
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:52,003
Are you blind that you cannot see
that this is the plan for Philip's conquest -

30
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:56,799
to extend his rule
city by city, state by state,

31
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,449
by bribery, treachery, force of arms?

32
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,881
- Yes?
- From Macedonia. Message for the king.

33
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,800
Philip.

34
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,118
Philip, wake up.
There's a messenger from Macedonia.

35
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,289
Ah, such dreams I had.

36
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:32,981
Such strange and troubled
drunken dreams.

37
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,171
A messenger...?

38
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,029
- What news do you bring? Good or bad?
- You have a son.

39
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,991
- A son?
- Born to the queen three weeks ago.

40
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,224
- I have a son.
- Alexander.

41
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:50,499
- That's the name the queen gave him.
- Alexander. And the queen?

42
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:53,210
- She sends you greetings.
- Greetings?

43
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,504
"To Philip. Hail and rejoice."

44
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:59,988
"On this day to Olympias,
your queen and wife, a god was born."

45
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,140
- A god?
- Those were the queen's words.

46
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:10,415
What mother in Greece has not dreamed
that her first-born was a god?

47
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,618
Hail, Philip, conqueror.

48
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,997
Hail, Egyptian.

49
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,481
I want to see my son.

50
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:45,093
(man #1) Looks like you -
the hair, the eyes.

51
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,595
(man #2) Even his beard!

52
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:50,515
You named him well: Alexander.

53
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,434
Alexander of Macedonia.

54
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,562
Alexander of Greece.

55
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,316
Little lion.

56
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:02,506
Little god.

57
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,032
I say, uh...

58
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,682
I've heard that legend.

59
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:14,288
There were signs
of greatness at his birth.

60
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:18,876
Quakes and storms shook the earth,
and in the skies a star fell.

61
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:22,422
And two eagles perched upon
the roof of the queen's chamber.

62
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:24,820
And in far off Asia,

63
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:29,304
the Temple of Ephesus was struck
by lightning and burnt to the ground.

64
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,806
How did you read these signs,
soothsayer?

65
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,707
The two eagles -
that he was born to rule two worlds.

66
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,584
The burning of the temple -

67
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:44,006
that a torch was kindled that day that
would one day consume all the world,

68
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,655
and this torch, your son.

69
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,329
And the falling of the star?

70
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:58,291
That a god was born to me... of a god.

71
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:01,732
(soothsayer) There were other signs
and portents of divinity.

72
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,651
Before his birth, the queen had a dream.

73
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,718
I had a dream, too, soothsayer.

74
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,263
One night on the battlefield
of Olynthus I had a dream.

75
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,766
I dreamed of death.

76
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:20,709
And when I awoke,
I didn't know whose death it was.

77
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,586
(crowd) We want Philip!

78
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,610
- Foretell it to me.
- Those shouts are for you.

79
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,989
The people have been waiting for hours
to see the king and his son.

80
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,792
- And if you kill him, what?
- Pleasure, bloody pleasure.

81
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,233
- And if you're wrong?
- An Egyptian soothsayer dies.

82
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,882
- And king Philip says to the world...?
- That he is also a man.

83
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:15,243
A madman! And if you are, play the role
and also kill her and the boy.

84
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:21,603
Kill her?

85
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,295
- And the boy?
- Why not?

86
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,841
Isn't it the ancient law
of the wild Macedonian chiefs?

87
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,656
You knew her when you married -
proud and jealous,

88
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:37,348
as wild as the mountains from which
she came and the gods she worshipped.

89
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:42,875
What she thinks I don't know, but this I do
know: She's a woman and she taunts you.

90
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,064
Taunts me?

91
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,818
Tears me.

92
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,572
And what do you believe, Parmenio?

93
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,283
Even the oracle at Delphi
proclaims his divinity.

94
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:59,037
- I've bought shrines and burned them.
- I accept the will of the gods.

95
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,539
And what do you believe?

96
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,293
I believe in the glory of Macedonia,
in the kingdom.

97
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,212
In the army,
forged with your will and your strength

98
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:13,009
and your belief that we were stronger and
more fit to rule than anyone in Greece,

99
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,511
even in Athens.

100
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,910
And you're right, Philip. We are.

101
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:21,976
We must proclaim to the world
that Macedonia will not fall apart,

102
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,147
that she will continue to rule
through you and through your son.

103
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:31,048
And then, Philip, we shall have truly lived.

104
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,820
Go to her.

105
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,887
You loved her once. At least
you can live in peace with her.

106
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:40,641
- Accept the boy. He's yours.
- (murmuring from crowd)

107
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:43,665
And give them what they want.

108
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,423
Alexander.

109
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,864
Alexander.

110
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,722
Achilles, too, was born of a god.

111
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:05,770
And at his birth it was foretold
that he would be greater than his father.

112
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:08,794
And he was.

113
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,799
And this destiny shall be yours,
too, Alexander.

114
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:16,718
Al...

115
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,458
They want to see the prince...

116
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:31,004
and the queen.

117
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:49,459
(crowd cheering)

118
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,226
- Greetings, Aristotle.
- Greetings, Alexander.

119
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,458
- Whose kill?
- His. Alone, on foot.

120
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:54,420
You should have seen it. It was like
a duel to decide which of them was king.

121
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,861
That duel need never have been fought.

122
00:12:57,965 --> 00:13:00,051
Cleitus is back.

123
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,241
Cleitus?

124
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,393
Cleitus. Black Cleitus!

125
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,061
- King.
- Companion.

126
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,398
Lucky Cleitus, to be the only one
amongst us chosen to go to war.

127
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:16,526
- For war you need men.
- Three years doesn't make a man.

128
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,611
What does, Philotas?

129
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,009
The news, friend. The news. My father?

130
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:24,138
He's well. He sends you greetings.
As do all your fathers.

131
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:27,787
- Were there many victories?
- Does the sun rise every morning?

132
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:30,394
- We even raided Persian soil.
- Persia!

133
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,669
Across the Bosphorus one night -
a quick, short, sharp raid.

134
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:37,588
Before they knew it,
we'd sacked three towns.

135
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,508
A Greek army on Persian soil -

136
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:45,722
the dream of Greece for 200 years,
and to Philip goes the glory.

137
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,016
Hail, Philip.

138
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:50,101
Hail, Philip!

139
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,272
Cleitus, why did my father send you here?

140
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,566
To train new troops and bring them back.

141
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,964
- And us?
- To train you, too, as always.

142
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:03,656
- And bring us back, too?
- I have no orders concerning that.

143
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,097
- Hail, Philip!
- Your father means you well.

144
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:10,642
I mean him well, and love him.
But he hoards his glory like a miser,

145
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,623
while we sit at the feet of Aristotle

146
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:16,273
and learn of great wonders of science,
of mathematics and of logic.

147
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:21,591
And maybe one of us will write a book
and be known as the pupil of Aristotle!

148
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,734
Aristotle... forgive me.

149
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:42,445
For what? You spoke like a king.

150
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,782
I, like a teacher.

151
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,891
- Your blood ran quick, too?
- At Cleitus' tale of the Persian raid? Yes.

152
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:55,270
For in that act I saw something
that might unite our torn and bloody land,

153
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,669
and put an end to Greeks killing Greeks,

154
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:01,527
and send them marching
under Philip on their holy mission -

155
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,072
to conquer Persia and destroy it.

156
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,574
Will Greece follow my father?

157
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,849
I do not know. Neither does he. Men
do not easily forget years of slaughter

158
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:15,186
and burning and pillage,
and deep and bitter hatreds.

159
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:19,983
And the cry of "Philip the Barbarian"
still echoes through the land.

160
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,798
He may conquer, but he will not rule.

161
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,533
Do you know how vast
the Persian Empire is?

162
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:32,495
From the Nile to the Indus,
from Samarkand to Babylon.

163
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,040
And beyond. Do you know
how many different people live there?

164
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:41,462
By heart. Carians, Armenians,
Jews, Parthians, Egyptians.

165
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,069
- I know their customs and their gods.
- Yes.

166
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:48,657
For this is more than an empire,
this is Colossus.

167
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:53,036
To rule it would take a man
as great as you can be.

168
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,582
That is why I say patience.

169
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,440
Patience? My time is short.

170
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,255
Short?

171
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:06,383
When the great god Zeus,
father of Achilles,

172
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:11,284
gave him his choice between a long life of
obscurity and a short one filled with glory,

173
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:13,995
he chose glory.

174
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,602
So did I.

175
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,791
Achilles died young.

176
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:31,721
Your friends are waiting for you
on the field. It's your turn to throw.

177
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:57,059
We Greeks are the chosen, the elect.

178
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:00,917
Our culture is the best,
our civilisation the best, our men the best.

179
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,253
- Now watch.
- (Aristotle) All others are barbarians,

180
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:08,007
and it is our moral duty
to conquer them, enslave them,

181
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:10,614
and, if necessary, destroy them.

182
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,913
Wonders are many, but none
is more wonderful than man himself.

183
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,918
The Persian way of life has
the seed of death and fear in it,

184
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,255
the Greek, of life and courage.

185
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,843
The gods of the Greeks
are made in the image of man.

186
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:36,265
Not men with birds' heads
and bulls with lions' heads,

187
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:41,061
but men who can be understood and felt.

188
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,668
"Thus beneath great-hearted Achilles
his whole-hooved horses

189
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,753
trampled corpses and shields together,

190
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,256
and with blood
all the axle-tree below was sprinkled,

191
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,550
for blood drops from
the horses' hooves splashed them,

192
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:52,844
and blood drops from
the tyres of the wheels."

193
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:55,450
"But the son of Peleus
pressed on to win glory,

194
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,370
flecking with gore his irresistible hands."

195
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:22,144
To place such responsibility on his
shoulders, to thrust manhood on a boy!

196
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:26,627
- Aristotle, we waste words.
- You waste a great man. In another year...

197
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:30,590
Another year?! In a year
I once swept through half Greece.

198
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,509
In another year they may sweep me back.

199
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:37,367
- This time victory is not on my spears.
- You asked for my opinion.

200
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:39,244
- I treasure it.
- You won't take it.

201
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,643
- Tell him why.
- There are many whys.

202
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,813
- I know them all.
- I know one. The queen.

203
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,690
- I know that one.
- Listen to him.

204
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:50,506
Listen to what?
Does he say the boy's not loyal?

205
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,757
- To you?
- To me.

206
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,946
- He'd lay his life down...
- I for him.

207
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:58,639
But you are asking him to make a choice
between the mind and the heart.

208
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:02,184
He'd make the right one.
I hold him to be a man.

209
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:17,095
An Illyrian spear through the knee.

210
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:21,474
What's an arm or a leg or an eye
for the sake of glory?

211
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,749
You've grown.
A year ago, when I left you here...

212
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,773
- Almost two.
- So it is.

213
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:32,005
Tall and straight as a spear.

214
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,987
A Macedonian spear.

215
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:47,333
- Do you come from Pella?
- No.

216
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,670
- Straight from the battlefield, to see you.
- Me?

217
00:19:52,964 --> 00:19:55,571
- How's your mother?
- When I last saw her, well.

218
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:58,177
- When was that?
- Several months ago. Why?

219
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:01,097
- Aristotle tells me you excel.
- Except in patience.

220
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:05,893
He's told me that, too.
And that you thirst for glory.

221
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,960
- When we hear news of your victories...
- Victories? There are none.

222
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:13,297
For the first time in 20 years,
Macedonians retreat.

223
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:16,008
- I've heard that, too.
- And what do you think?

224
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:19,240
That my father's name
is Philip of Macedonia.

225
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:23,411
Can you rule in Pella while I fight?

226
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:29,563
- Rule in Pella?
- There is a revolt there.

227
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:33,629
In my capital, in my palace!
That's why I'm back.

228
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:36,862
There must be loyalty
here to the House of Philip.

229
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:40,094
Can you rule? Aristotle stands opposed.

230
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,952
Who else?

231
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:45,933
Attalus.

232
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,313
And you?

233
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,815
I rode 200 leagues to Mieza.

234
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,526
I can rule.

235
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,446
- At all costs?
- I can rule.

236
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,953
Tomorrow morning, when the sun is high,

237
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:09,082
I want you and your companions
to ride into Pella.

238
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,731
And there, in full view
of the entire populace,

239
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:16,276
I'll proclaim you regent in Macedonia.

240
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:20,864
- I'll go and tell the others.
- Alexander.

241
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:36,088
There's work to do. Farewell, Aristotle.

242
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:40,467
Farewell. Take these words with you,
and use them for what they're worth.

243
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:45,159
Alexander is many things.
He's logic and he's dreams.

244
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:49,539
He's warrior and he's poet.
He's man and he's spirit.

245
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,667
He's your son, but he's also hers,

246
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:56,108
and he believes himself to be a god.

247
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,601
(dog barks)

248
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:00,026
(women's laughter and music)

249
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,673
Alexander!

250
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:50,180
The night was a thousand years.
When I heard last night that you...

251
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:53,413
You heard last night that I was coming?
From whom?

252
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:57,792
Oh, a man... a soldier... a messenger.
I don't remember.

253
00:23:58,001 --> 00:24:00,920
I couldn't wait.
I wanted to come to you, to warn you.

254
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,048
- To what?
- No. No, not to warn you. To beg you.

255
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:07,281
- To warn me? To beg me?
- I vowed to the gods that...

256
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:09,992
Mother, say what you want to say.

257
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,120
He's gone mad.
No one was safe in Pella this night.

258
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,310
Philip has gone mad.

259
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:20,732
- Send them away.
- They're my friends, here for safety.

260
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,817
Send them away!

261
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:28,865
What's all this about my father?

262
00:24:29,073 --> 00:24:34,078
To the sword, the cross, the rack,
men that have been his friends for years.

263
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:38,875
Now everyone is his enemy. He accuses
everyone of conspiring against him.

264
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:44,088
Even me. You'll hear that story,
Alexander. You'll hear it from him.

265
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:47,321
But you mustn't believe it.
You mustn't. You don't, do you?

266
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,927
Why should he accuse you?

267
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:55,767
He wants to get rid of me.
He's been wanting to for years.

268
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:58,790
He wants to marry again.

269
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:01,606
- Who?
- Attalus's niece.

270
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:05,255
You be careful of Attalus.
You be careful of all of them.

271
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:08,175
She's no fool.

272
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:12,763
She won't let him throw her away like
he's done with all the others. She's young.

273
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:14,744
Mother!

274
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:21,104
Whatever he asks of you, do.
Whatever he says, agree with.

275
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:23,711
For when you're regent...

276
00:25:23,816 --> 00:25:28,612
When you're regent, then... we'll rule.

277
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,323
We?

278
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:35,285
Your father will see you now.

279
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,178
Have you seen your mother?

280
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,307
Yes.

281
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,563
An act of revolt
against the state is treason.

282
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,212
In giving you the regency,
I give you power.

283
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:31,070
Power is absolute -
if you don't use it, you lose it.

284
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,198
- My father always spoke bluntly.
- Did he?

285
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:39,412
That's not what people say.
They say "Philip, the cunning", "the fox".

286
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,706
- Speak bluntly now.
- I do not choose to.

287
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:46,502
- Then I do not choose to answer.
- Who says choice is yours? Alexander!

288
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:49,109
All I ask is truth.

289
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:53,906
- I've been at Mieza all this time.
- You saw her. Many times you saw her.

290
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,451
- Whenever I could.
- And never did you hear about this plot?

291
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,683
It's your choice as king
to put me on the rack.

292
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,522
There's a man on the rack now,
a kinsman of your mother's,

293
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:09,338
who, before he died, screamed her name.

294
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:11,632
Torture makes men scream blasphemies.

295
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,968
- Is it blasphemy to speak her name?
- In foul lies, yes.

296
00:27:15,073 --> 00:27:18,201
And if I brought you proof
that this revolt was brewed by her?

297
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:21,954
If I brought you proof, and you brought
me proof, and we swore to heaven?

298
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,874
Here we stand,
and you believe in me or you don't!

299
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,959
I want to.

300
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:30,400
- And I want you to.
- Then listen.

301
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:33,320
And listen carefully, boy. This woman...

302
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:35,927
- My mother.
...wants to rule.

303
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:39,889
She is the queen.

304
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:44,477
You asked for blunt words -
so she's called.

305
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,525
There is no love between us. She can
only rule through you. You are her power.

306
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,444
And her pawn.

307
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,155
- I'm no one's pawn.
- Are you sure?

308
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:02,307
A rumour here in Pella -
the Macedonian army is defeated.

309
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:06,061
Philip is dying. Philip is dead.
Rumours, rumours.

310
00:28:06,165 --> 00:28:09,293
- Spread by whom?
- By her. Here in Pella, chaos.

311
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,109
Who rules? She does.

312
00:28:12,213 --> 00:28:16,175
Antipater, my regent, dare not oppose her,
for she claims she rules for you.

313
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:19,721
To back up that claim, she calls on
her brother, the king of Epirus.

314
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:22,640
For the first time
since I took power in Macedonia,

315
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,038
a foreign army stands on its borders.

316
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:29,522
Now she has the power she seeks, for
Antipater dare not use his troops in war.

317
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:35,153
So he gives in to her, for he knows that
I may need those troops. And I do!

318
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:38,177
Now there's no longer chaos in Pella,
there's murder.

319
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,262
Some of my best men died.

320
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:45,580
What does it matter that the Macedonian
Empire crumbles? She rules in Pella!

321
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:49,438
This is why Attalus
stood opposed last night at Mieza.

322
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,921
Is it?

323
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,945
And why Parmenio stood in silence.

324
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,865
They were afraid of her hold on you.

325
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:02,680
I am not.

326
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:08,936
Alexander, as your first act as regent,
send your mother away.

327
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,776
- Exile my mother?
- Back to her kinsmen in Epirus.

328
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,278
- She'll be happy.
- Is that the cost of my proof?

329
00:29:17,487 --> 00:29:19,989
How do you think I came to power?
My brothers...

330
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:24,056
I know. You slew them.
Do you want me to do that, too?

331
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,828
Why didn't you ask me this
last night in Mieza?

332
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:32,085
And if I do this, then, Father,
I'll be your pawn, won't I?

333
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:36,673
Aristotle was right.
You're not ready to rule.

334
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:40,322
All you're fit for is to fight and die
like any Macedonian soldier.

335
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:44,493
Then at least live like one.
Get drunk. Choose a woman.

336
00:29:44,597 --> 00:29:46,161
I do!

337
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,247
I choose her!

338
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:50,019
Young fool!

339
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:52,939
Fool! You fool!

340
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:57,527
By my right as king,

341
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:00,968
I give you, Alexander of Macedonia,
the seal of regency.

342
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:06,077
With this seal, you rule in my absence
as though you were king.

343
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:12,542
You have the power to collect taxes, raise
troops, make war and hold royal court.

344
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,627
For as it is with the king,

345
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:18,589
according to ancient Macedonian law,
so it is with his regent.

346
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:22,343
He is, in his single person,
lord of all things,

347
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:27,035
both open and secret,
at once general and absolute.

348
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:48,619
I am leaving Antipater
here as your adviser.

349
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:54,354
Alexander, there's another
ancient law of kingship -

350
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,838
to trust no one,

351
00:31:00,923 --> 00:31:03,843
and to learn how to be alone.

352
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,200
Are you asleep?

353
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:28,972
No.

354
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:33,456
You're regent now.

355
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,105
Not because he wanted it so,
but because he had no choice.

356
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,921
You're regent now.

357
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:42,110
Good night, Mother.

358
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,409
- Alexander, I swear to you...
- Do not swear, Mother.

359
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:54,102
Who else should
I have fought for except you?

360
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,751
What other love do I have?

361
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:03,069
There were rumours of his death.
He was being defeated.

362
00:32:03,277 --> 00:32:05,780
There were others
who claimed the crown.

363
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,865
Why, Mother?

364
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:11,723
The crown is mine
by right of birth, isn't it?

365
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:16,728
You wanted to swear before.
Swear that!

366
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,316
By divine right.

367
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,075
Good night, Mother.

368
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:36,853
Good night, Alexander.

369
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:45,403
- There's peace in the hills.
- The tribes revolted against the king.

370
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:49,365
- Your father may need these troops.
- The regent is, in my father's words,

371
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:54,370
lord of all things, open and secret,
general and absolute.

372
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:30,761
You will rebuild your city here
and name it Alexandropolis.

373
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:35,974
No man's pawn.

374
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,164
(fanfare)

375
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:36,451
I return this seal of regency, as ordered.

376
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,456
The news is that
you move against Athens.

377
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:44,793
The news here is that
you move against hill tribesmen.

378
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:49,485
That you set men free whom I imprisoned.
That you set up statues to yourself.

379
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,822
That you name cities after yourself.
That you're all heroes.

380
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,220
- Mine were the orders, they obeyed.
- Yes.

381
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:59,078
You ruled well in Pella... for yourself.

382
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:04,500
How many Macedonian troops that I could
use have you lost on your road to glory?

383
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:09,088
This leg of mine!

384
00:35:09,297 --> 00:35:14,406
How could you, sir, regret a wound that at
every step reminds us of your conquests?

385
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,644
Alexander, walk with me.

386
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:34,009
- You have my temper.
- I know.

387
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:37,346
And my ambition. More, I think.

388
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,640
Alexandropolis!

389
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:41,829
At least wait until I die.

390
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:57,887
I've given you command
of the left wing of my cavalry.

391
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:59,973
This time we'll crush them.

392
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:03,518
I'll ride into Athens.
And what'll they cry then?

393
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:08,001
"Philip the Barbarian" or
"Philip, captain general of all Greece"?

394
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,442
You will ride with me.

395
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:17,073
Alexander, this girl, Attalus' niece,

396
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,575
she means very much to me.

397
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:49,918
My name is Eurydice.

398
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:52,108
I know your name.

399
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:55,132
Are you afraid to speak to me?

400
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:56,904
Afraid?

401
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:00,658
Forgive me for using
the word "afraid" to Alexander.

402
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:04,933
- Laughter sits well on your face.
- And on yours.

403
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:07,644
- Could there be a bond between us?
- A bond?

404
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:10,981
- I will not have you frown.
- Command comes easily to you.

405
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,465
It was not a command.
An entreaty, a wish.

406
00:37:23,181 --> 00:37:25,683
You are very young.

407
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:28,394
Older than you by a year.

408
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:30,167
And very beautiful.

409
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:38,509
You look at a woman
like your father does.

410
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:41,637
Perhaps I'm... jealous.

411
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:44,661
I am... of his love for you.

412
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:49,353
- Flattery comes easily to you, too.
- Does Alexander need flattery?

413
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:53,419
Truth.

414
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:55,609
Why did you come here?

415
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,823
To find out if there
will be hate between us.

416
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:04,055
- Once, when I was much younger...
- Much?

417
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,828
Very much.

418
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:09,581
...my father took a new woman into
the house. I went to him and spoke out.

419
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,691
For my father has had many wives and
mistresses, and many children by them.

420
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:16,776
There will be hate between us.

421
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,530
As I said, I was young
and did not understand my father.

422
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:24,492
"Why" I asked "must there always
be new rivals for the throne?"

423
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:27,099
He threw back his head,
laughed, and he said

424
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:30,853
"My boy, if I surround you
with competitors

425
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:34,293
you will have all the more reason
to surpass them in merit."

426
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:40,341
My father, as I said,
had many wives and mistresses.

427
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:49,934
- Tears spring easily to your eyes.
- I do not wear a mask as you do.

428
00:38:50,143 --> 00:38:53,271
What I am is on my face,
and what I see is on my tongue.

429
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,086
And what do you see?

430
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:02,342
A young girl, an old man
and an ambitious general called Attalus.

431
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:07,556
And love?
You do not see that at all, do you?

432
00:39:10,788 --> 00:39:13,916
- This is not the way I wanted it.
- What do you want?

433
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:21,215
To be able to love Philip,
and to be loved in turn... in peace.

434
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:27,263
As his mistress, his wife or his queen?

435
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,349
As his queen.

436
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,102
So be it.

437
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:39,776
Alexander, I told you before,

438
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:42,799
this girl means very much to me.

439
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:49,473
The Thebans will not let us pass.
We fight tomorrow.

440
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,288
To fight means perhaps to die.

441
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:56,876
Again, please,
let there be no quarrel between us.

442
00:39:58,336 --> 00:40:01,881
I said... so be it.

443
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,014
(Demosthenes) Again,
the Macedonian is on the march -

444
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:14,081
the wolf, Philip,
and his whelp, Alexander.

445
00:40:14,185 --> 00:40:17,626
Again, all we hold sacred is in peril.

446
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,441
But here, at Chaeronea,

447
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,404
the fate of Greece
will once and for all be decided.

448
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:28,157
Shall it live under freedom? Or tyranny?

449
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:35,248
For this sacred struggle, even the graves
of our fathers will yield up their dead.

450
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:36,603
Athenians!

451
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:41,608
Macedonians!

452
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,637
(Philip) Demosthenes declares openly

453
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:53,078
that the battle of Chaeronea
will decide once and for all

454
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:56,311
who is to be master in Greece.

455
00:40:56,415 --> 00:41:00,377
Macedonians, give him his answer!

456
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,645
Hail, Alexander, hero.
Hero of Chaeronea.

457
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:33,343
We Athenians would like
permission to bury our dead.

458
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:38,660
Let them lie and rot on the field of
Chaeronea till they stink to the heavens.

459
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:04,102
To the hero of Chaeronea!

460
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:06,501
(all) Alexander!

461
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:10,359
And now... to the victor.

462
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:13,383
- To me!
- To Philip!

463
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,259
- To Philip.
- (laughter)

464
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:17,866
Fierce in battle, generous in victory.

465
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:24,227
You see, Memnon?

466
00:44:24,435 --> 00:44:27,146
I defeat you and
I invite you to dine with me.

467
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:30,587
Isn't that the way
an Athenian gentleman behaves?

468
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:34,028
I could destroy Athens now, but I won't.

469
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:38,095
To destroy a centre of culture
would be the act of a barbarian.

470
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:40,493
And that, Philip is not.

471
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:46,749
Is he, Memnon?

472
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:48,835
Is he, Athenians?

473
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:53,840
Is he, Demosthenes?

474
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,906
Is he, Demosthenes?

475
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:00,096
Is he?

476
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:02,286
Is he, Demosthenes?

477
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:06,456
Is he, Demosthenes?

478
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,480
Philip the Barbarian.

479
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:11,983
? Philip the Barbarian

480
00:45:12,191 --> 00:45:14,694
? Philip the Barbarian

481
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:21,054
Philip the Barbarian dances over
your dead bodies, you Athenians!

482
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:26,998
Father, you're Philip of Macedonia,
now captain general of all Greece.

483
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:32,524
You're right. My victory,
my kingdom, my Greece!

484
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:34,610
Not yours!

485
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:37,216
Philip the Barbarian!

486
00:45:37,425 --> 00:45:39,198
Alexander.

487
00:45:44,932 --> 00:45:47,018
Too much to drink.

488
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:50,772
Much too much to drink.

489
00:46:04,118 --> 00:46:05,995
Athenians...

490
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:08,915
Demosthenes...

491
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,214
Saved my life.

492
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:19,446
He could have been king. Saved my life.

493
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:23,617
Don't ever forget that.

494
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:27,996
? Philip the Barbarian

495
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:29,978
? Philip the Barbarian

496
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,854
? Philip...

497
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:35,191
A young girl...

498
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:39,466
and a drunken, foolish old man.

499
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:16,065
In tribute to the heroic Athenian dead,

500
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:21,592
I send their ashes back to Athens
under the escort of my son Alexander.

501
00:47:21,696 --> 00:47:23,990
And there, in Athens,

502
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:29,203
a treaty of peace will be drawn up
between us by my son Alexander.

503
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:37,649
To all those who died like men on
the bloody field of Chaeronea, all hail!

504
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:01,423
Alexander rides to Athens,

505
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:03,404
and I stay here.

506
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:05,698
It was a wise decision.

507
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:08,931
To win the war and lose the peace is folly.

508
00:48:10,182 --> 00:48:12,580
There'd be no cheers for you in Athens.

509
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:17,689
Only hatred, and perhaps
an assassin's dagger at your throat.

510
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:24,258
When and where
will I meet that dagger, friend?

511
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:54,810
To my humble home, Alexander, and in
the name of Athens, I bid you welcome.

512
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:57,417
Oratory, Demosthenes,
is a noble profession,

513
00:48:57,521 --> 00:49:01,900
and, I am told, a rewarding one.
How humble is your home, Aeschenes?

514
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,341
Almost Macedonian -
empty of all, save victories.

515
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:07,010
- Well said.
- Well rehearsed.

516
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:08,678
And well acted.

517
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:13,474
I have heard that there are no two better
actors than Demosthenes and Aeschenes.

518
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:17,645
I should like to witness a performance.
And I should like to know,

519
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:23,067
where were all these wonderful physiques
when we defeated you at Chaeronea?

520
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,840
Memnon.

521
00:49:24,944 --> 00:49:28,698
Had so great a victory been mine,
I would have said the same.

522
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,783
My wife, Barsine.

523
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:33,807
- Barsine.
- And this, Stratocles, Athenian senator.

524
00:49:34,016 --> 00:49:38,082
Thocian, general. Charidemus,
commander of the Athenian fleet.

525
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:45,694
- Barsine is a Persian name.
- I am both Persian and Greek.

526
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:49,656
Athens is now my home.
Both my husband and I love it very much.

527
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:54,766
My father once said "Athens is
neither a city nor a state. It's an idea."

528
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,477
I can understand that now that I'm here.

529
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:02,794
And Aristotle taught me that an idea
is greater than a man. An idea is divine.

530
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:06,131
Do you believe that?

531
00:50:23,544 --> 00:50:26,047
We demand no ransom nor tribute.

532
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,009
All Athenian prisoners of war
shall go free.

533
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:32,512
We ask that all Greek
city states and nations

534
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:36,995
agree that no Greek in any part
of the world shall bear arms against us.

535
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,185
- And that is all?
- No.

536
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:44,816
Each state here agrees to supply men,
arms and ships for the war against Persia.

537
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,091
Unlimited men?
Unlimited arms? Unlimited ships?

538
00:50:49,195 --> 00:50:51,802
- Till victory be won.
- Whose victory?

539
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,574
These are the terms.

540
00:50:53,783 --> 00:50:59,831
You see? We have lost the right to choose
for whom and for what we are to die.

541
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:01,708
What have you gained?

542
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:06,608
For the first time in history, Greece is able
to measure its strength with any empire.

543
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:11,926
A nation with a destiny, a divine mission
to bring Greek culture to all the world.

544
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:15,471
Or have your ideas
grown greater than your men?

545
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:18,808
Now you have that unity
and strength to fulfil that mission.

546
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,936
And this is what I have brought you.

547
00:51:26,941 --> 00:51:30,903
Philip of Macedonia further decrees
that no Macedonian troops...

548
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:35,074
Philip of Macedon
used words to gain his ends.

549
00:51:35,283 --> 00:51:37,785
This boy believes in what he says.

550
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:21,892
Mother, I have brought you
many tales from Athens,

551
00:52:21,996 --> 00:52:25,124
and many gifts - gifts for a queen.

552
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:28,878
Bring them to her, not to me.
I am queen no longer.

553
00:52:36,177 --> 00:52:40,556
- Queen no longer?
- Divorced by your father's royal decree.

554
00:52:40,765 --> 00:52:45,040
Philip has said to all Greece that his wife,
your mother, is unfaithful.

555
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:49,837
- I am leaving Pella.
- Also by royal decree?

556
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:53,069
Not by his words, by his deeds.

557
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:55,467
Here I am alone.

558
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:58,387
Behind my back, laughter.

559
00:52:58,491 --> 00:53:02,870
Olympias wants no one's pity.
I'll be treated like I once was or...

560
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:07,458
I did not think I had any tears left to shed.

561
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:10,065
No!

562
00:53:10,795 --> 00:53:12,568
No, Alexander.

563
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:16,426
Go to his wedding in peace.
Accept it as the will of the gods.

564
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:19,137
I have my destiny, you have yours.

565
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:43,223
Greetings, companion... my son.

566
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:50,522
Alexander.

567
00:53:56,153 --> 00:54:01,471
How do I tear down this wall that stands
between us? By breach? Assault? Storm?

568
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:04,286
- You built the wall.
- How? By marrying Eurydice?

569
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:07,518
- You said "So be it."
- Were my words all you needed?

570
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:10,229
- No.
- Then why seek my approval now?

571
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:12,940
Because you're my son.

572
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:15,547
Your divorce stated
my mother was unfaithful.

573
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:19,197
Everyone worships the gods
in their own way. Your mother...

574
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:21,595
- But it states...
- That was a mistake.

575
00:54:21,804 --> 00:54:24,827
- A mistake that threw dirt on my name.
- I was angry, sick.

576
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:28,373
- I acted without thinking.
- Not you, Father.

577
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:32,960
You've never done a thing without
weighing it on the scale of your ambition.

578
00:54:33,899 --> 00:54:38,174
You give, not because you want to.
You made me regent.

579
00:54:38,383 --> 00:54:41,198
You gave me my command at Chaeronea,
sent me to Athens.

580
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:47,871
You, Alexander! You high-minded
philosopher, you god among men,

581
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,251
why did you accept,
if not for love of the same things?

582
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:55,692
In heaven's name,
let's talk of things as they really are.

583
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:59,028
A Macedonian princess!

584
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:03,720
Not from Epirus,
nor Athens, but Macedonia.

585
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:17,380
Is it in your mind
to cut me out of the succession?

586
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:21,968
You play a dangerous game with me, boy.

587
00:55:22,176 --> 00:55:24,262
And you with me.

588
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:28,016
If you think victory at Chaeronea
made you greater than you are,

589
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,769
- you'd better measure your shadow.
- I have measured it.

590
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:34,272
Why should that be in my mind?

591
00:55:34,376 --> 00:55:38,130
Because you now see me as a rival,
not as a son.

592
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:43,760
If I did, you wouldn't be alive.

593
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:49,183
Give me your hand.

594
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:51,685
Give it to me!

595
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,813
To the new queen!

596
00:55:54,917 --> 00:56:00,861
And may the gods at long last give to
Macedonia a legitimate heir to the throne.

597
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:05,970
You stupid, drunken fool!

598
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:09,411
You dare to call me a bastard?!

599
00:56:15,146 --> 00:56:16,189
Alexander!

600
00:56:22,654 --> 00:56:23,905
Look at him!

601
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:27,971
This is the man who is preparing
to pass from Europe into Asia,

602
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,099
but cannot even pass
from one couch to another.

603
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:52,684
Mother, get dressed.
We leave Pella tonight.

604
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,480
(trumpet call)

605
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:05,300
(herald) To all men in Greece,
hail and rejoice.

606
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:10,827
On this day, to Philip of Macedonia
and his queen, Eurydice,

607
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:13,955
a son has been born.

608
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,770
These are Philip's words:

609
00:57:16,874 --> 00:57:19,898
Let all strife cease.

610
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,922
Let all crimes be pardoned.

611
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:26,467
Let all in exile return home.

612
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:08,906
Your father bids you welcome.

613
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:13,702
The city states have sent
their quota in men and arms.

614
00:58:13,806 --> 00:58:17,664
We march on Persia before the month
is out. There will be three armies.

615
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:20,584
You will command
the one that marches east.

616
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:22,774
And Attalus?

617
00:58:22,982 --> 00:58:26,944
He marches south with me. The
ceremonies that will be held at Pella...

618
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:30,698
- For the birth of his son?
- For many reasons.

619
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,262
...are very important.

620
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:36,537
All the ambassadors of Greece are here,
as an expression of their loyalty.

621
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:39,561
It's fitting that you appear
at your father's side.

622
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:43,419
- My mother is to be treated with honour?
- Agreed.

623
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,922
I want the king's word for that.

624
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:51,761
Agreed.

625
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:55,515
Within the week, four of your companions
are to be banished.

626
00:58:55,723 --> 00:59:01,041
Harpalus, Ptolemy,
my son Philotas, and Pausanias.

627
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:06,150
- Why?
- Because I think it best.

628
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:10,113
- Is their loyalty to me treason?
- When it sets you against me.

629
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:13,345
I believe this is what they have done
from Chaeronea onwards,

630
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,369
even during the months
that you were in exile.

631
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:19,497
- I've heard reports.
- And I have, too.

632
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:22,938
I know the reason
that I'm back here in Pella.

633
00:59:23,147 --> 00:59:27,005
I saw it in the streets.
You need me here.

634
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:30,758
- On this, I'm firm.
- And I am, too!

635
00:59:31,592 --> 00:59:33,886
Let theirs be the choice.

636
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:36,285
Philotas?

637
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,204
I accept.

638
00:59:44,939 --> 00:59:47,129
Then it's done.

639
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:50,674
Done.

640
00:59:55,575 --> 00:59:57,452
Pausanias?

641
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:06,836
How will you be able to live
without your... god, Alexander?

642
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,504
(Philip chuckles)

643
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:11,215
I accepted exile, not disgrace.

644
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,405
(laughter)

645
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,354
And Philip laughed?

646
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:27,273
As though I were a stable boy.

647
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:31,027
Your quarrel's not with Attalus,
but with Philip.

648
01:00:31,235 --> 01:00:35,093
For Philip could have done you justice,
but he laughed.

649
01:00:36,449 --> 01:00:41,350
Come take the sword,
this wretched hand of mine.

650
01:00:41,454 --> 01:00:44,895
One deed, one act of glory.

651
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:51,360
My father once asked what a man should
do to hand his name down to posterity.

652
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:56,782
He replied "kill the person who has
accomplished the greatest deeds,

653
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:02,621
and then, whenever that person
is spoken of, he too will be remembered."

654
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,332
- Mother!
- Alexander!

655
01:01:05,436 --> 01:01:10,441
Pausanias, friend,
you've had much to drink.

656
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:13,465
Go now and sleep. And tomorrow...

657
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,446
Tomorrow?

658
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:20,243
Tomorrow... king!

659
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:29,002
Mother... what thoughts
do you put in his head?

660
01:01:30,044 --> 01:01:33,485
- None that are not already there.
- And what's in yours?

661
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,466
- A name.
- Whose?

662
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:36,926
A baby's, the king's new son.

663
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:41,618
Philip has named him karanos.

664
01:01:41,723 --> 01:01:43,808
A name, like any other.

665
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:48,396
The king who founded the Macedonian
royal family was named karanos.

666
01:01:50,898 --> 01:01:53,297
What's in Philip's mind?

667
01:02:14,672 --> 01:02:18,947
(Olympias) What's in Philip's mind?
What's in Philip's mind?

668
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:26,872
What's in Philip's mind?

669
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:35,631
(crowd cheers)

670
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:07,016
Walk in front of me.

671
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,500
I'll walk alone.

672
01:03:43,407 --> 01:03:45,388
(crowd screams)

673
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:08,119
Leave him alone.

674
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:18,755
Alexander!

675
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:55,667
May the gods curse the killer
from now till evermore,

676
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:58,169
whoever the killer may be.

677
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:07,762
Father,

678
01:05:11,516 --> 01:05:15,269
neither on my hands... nor in my heart.

679
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:18,919
I swear it.

680
01:05:44,882 --> 01:05:46,864
(fanfare)

681
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:17,415
(Alexander) I hear you wait
to declare who is to be your king.

682
01:06:23,463 --> 01:06:26,904
According to ancient privilege,
it is the right of the army,

683
01:06:27,008 --> 01:06:32,013
both by law and force of arms,
to decide who shall be their king.

684
01:06:48,696 --> 01:06:53,493
The hand that plunged the dagger into my
father's body was the hand of my friend.

685
01:06:53,597 --> 01:06:55,578
And I slew my friend.

686
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:58,602
My father's murder was carefully planned.

687
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:03,294
My friend was a tool
used by others for larger ends,

688
01:07:03,503 --> 01:07:06,214
by men whose purses
bulge with Persian gold,

689
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,802
and who, for this gold, would betray
their country and their holy cause.

690
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:13,826
From Demosthenes,
the rabble-rouser in Athens,

691
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,641
to men here in Pella.

692
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:20,916
And there is not world enough
nor time enough

693
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,523
for these men to escape my vengeance.

694
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:29,883
Soldiers, you were assembled
here on the plains of Axios

695
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:36,244
by my father, Philip,
to be led to the greatest glory and riches

696
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:41,770
that any army since the world began
has ever yet achieved -

697
01:07:41,874 --> 01:07:47,088
the conquest and destruction
of the Persian Empire.

698
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:53,240
Nothing is changed
but the name of the king!

699
01:07:53,344 --> 01:07:58,036
(soldiers) Alexander!
Alexander! Alexander!

700
01:08:02,729 --> 01:08:04,710
(chanting continues)

701
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:38,076
Delegates of the Greek states
here assembled,

702
01:08:38,285 --> 01:08:42,352
at the Treaty of Corinth you elected
my father captain general of all Greece,

703
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:44,541
and pledged him loyalty.

704
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:49,442
I claim that loyalty, and his titles, now.

705
01:08:50,902 --> 01:08:52,883
Corinth?

706
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,575
We pledge it.

707
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,556
Thebes?

708
01:09:02,059 --> 01:09:04,040
Thessaly?

709
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,419
Argos?

710
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:14,571
Athens?

711
01:09:15,614 --> 01:09:18,638
Do you place value on pledges
given at the point of spears?

712
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:22,392
If broken, I'll not hesitate at
the gates of Athens, as my father did.

713
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,145
I do not doubt that, Alexander.
And you do not have my oath.

714
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:30,316
For it is sacred only when,
as a Greek, I have free choice.

715
01:09:31,672 --> 01:09:35,947
Memnon, to be exiled from Greece
for the rest of his life.

716
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:39,283
With, of course, the approval of Athens.

717
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:46,895
I also order the arrests of Aeropas
and Hermanes for high treason.

718
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:51,066
To be executed in accordance
with our ancient law.

719
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:17,134
(Alexander) Eurydice.

720
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:21,826
- She was very dear to me.
- She was as my child.

721
01:10:22,869 --> 01:10:25,893
Then bury her like a queen,
not like a thief in the night.

722
01:10:25,997 --> 01:10:28,708
We Macedonians are a religious people.

723
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:32,774
- A suicide must be buried in the night.
- Suicide?

724
01:10:32,879 --> 01:10:35,590
So it will read.
She took her own life.

725
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,031
- The babe?
- Plucked from her,

726
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:42,055
and thrown into
the sacrificial flames in front of her.

727
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,600
For your mother is a religious woman
and seeks to appease the gods.

728
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:47,998
Is the tale too horrible for your ears?

729
01:10:48,102 --> 01:10:52,482
Shall I tell you, too, who placed the noose
around her pretty, white young neck?

730
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:56,757
But I am a religious man,
and accept the will of the gods.

731
01:10:58,008 --> 01:11:02,387
What's man's fate is man's fate,
both yours and mine.

732
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,243
O Father...

733
01:11:46,494 --> 01:11:51,395
O Father Zeus,
I will lay victories upon your altar

734
01:11:51,499 --> 01:11:56,087
the like of which
no man or god has ever seen.

735
01:12:53,853 --> 01:12:57,920
You god, that gave him to me,

736
01:12:58,024 --> 01:13:03,237
and for whom I have kept him
all these years, do not break your vow.

737
01:13:03,863 --> 01:13:08,138
If his life be short, as is the prophecy,

738
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:12,622
give him in that short span of life
that which is the prophecy also:

739
01:13:14,082 --> 01:13:17,210
Eternal glory to the end of time.

740
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:04,862
I now claim the whole of Asia...
land won by the spear.

741
01:14:29,991 --> 01:14:34,057
(Memnon) I oppose meeting Alexander,
now in battle, at the River Granicus.

742
01:14:34,162 --> 01:14:38,541
This is Asia, where space is as vast
as time, and both are on our side.

743
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:41,773
Here to the east -
mountains, desert, wasteland,

744
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:43,963
2,000 thirsty miles to Babylon.

745
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:48,030
Here, along the shores of Asia Minor -
rich cities, good harbours.

746
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:51,888
Here - Alexander, with neither
enough men, money or supplies

747
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:56,893
to do anything now but live off the land.
He must move down the coast.

748
01:14:56,997 --> 01:14:58,665
What do you propose?

749
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:01,585
Retreat and destroy
everything before him.

750
01:15:01,689 --> 01:15:04,087
Let him conquer nothing
but burned-out land.

751
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:09,092
And when his supplies are gone, his lines
cut... At a time and place of our choosing.

752
01:15:09,301 --> 01:15:12,221
Retreat before this boy,
this adventurer, this pirate?!

753
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:16,391
This boy brought Greece to its knees
in 16 months. It took his father 20 years.

754
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,667
This is the Persian Empire. If necessary,
we can put a million men against him.

755
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:25,359
But not at Granicus. There we stand equal
in numbers. I fight one battle at a time.

756
01:15:25,463 --> 01:15:27,757
Then let us fight it
and have done with talk!

757
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:30,989
- Talk?! Then fight it by yourselves.
- Memnon!

758
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:38,705
Darius, Emperor,
you hired my skill in war.

759
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:42,981
- He also hired your courage.
- If I doubted either, he would not be here.

760
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:44,857
Speak, Memnon.

761
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:47,151
My lords of Persia, listen well.

762
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,758
Alexander is like a lion
on the scent of blood.

763
01:15:49,862 --> 01:15:52,886
He needs a fight, a kill,
and he needs it quickly.

764
01:15:52,991 --> 01:15:55,806
If you feed the growing legend
of his invincibility,

765
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:59,351
if you give him victory in Persia,
if we are defeated at Granicus...

766
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:01,228
You seem too sure of that, Greek.

767
01:16:01,332 --> 01:16:04,773
The cities along the shores
of Asia Minor will go over to him.

768
01:16:04,877 --> 01:16:09,361
- For they still consider themselves Greek.
- Persian for 200 years.

769
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:12,385
Greek or Persian,
a man's roots are a man's roots.

770
01:16:12,593 --> 01:16:15,409
Are they?

771
01:16:15,513 --> 01:16:18,016
Is there also a doubt here of my loyalty?

772
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:23,542
My lords, let me speak bluntly.

773
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,296
I am a Greek, as you did call me,
taking arms against a Greek.

774
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:31,675
This is not a game for me or for my men.
We have to win, as do you.

775
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:34,490
This is a professional army we face.

776
01:16:34,699 --> 01:16:37,514
You spoke bluntly, now I will.

777
01:16:37,618 --> 01:16:41,268
These lands you speak of burning
are ours. The crops are ours.

778
01:16:41,477 --> 01:16:43,770
Handed down to the nobles of Persia

779
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:46,899
by the great kings of Persia
thousands of years ago -

780
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:50,861
when men still lived like beasts
on those Greek islands of his.

781
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:55,136
Not a foot of land,
not a grain of wheat will be destroyed.

782
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,743
This is our decision, Darius, Emperor.

783
01:16:58,473 --> 01:17:02,435
We will meet Alexander at Granicus,
and we will destroy his army!

784
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:05,146
And I will kill him.

785
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:08,378
- On your heads.
- On our heads.

786
01:17:08,483 --> 01:17:11,715
Do you have stomach for this fight,
Memnon?

787
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:48,210
Break of day?

788
01:17:48,314 --> 01:17:50,608
Our women also wait.

789
01:17:57,281 --> 01:17:59,367
For time is a thief.

790
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:03,538
I am not sending you to Babylon.

791
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:06,666
Who, then, will the king hold
as hostage for your loyalty?

792
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:11,358
You'll go to Miletus with the rest of the
women and wait for news of Granicus.

793
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,093
- As you will.
- As I will.

794
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,994
I will many things.

795
01:18:25,747 --> 01:18:29,084
I can't believe in what you're doing.
Nor do I think that you do.

796
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:32,421
- You have eyes and cannot see.
- I see that I have no choice.

797
01:18:32,525 --> 01:18:36,904
- No choice but to lead Greeks to death?
- They're mercenaries. They fight for pay.

798
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:40,971
- And you?
- You ask me that now?

799
01:18:41,075 --> 01:18:43,891
Shall I ask it of your body
when it's brought back?

800
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:47,540
- Would you have me play the traitor?
- What would you betray?

801
01:18:47,644 --> 01:18:52,962
Half the night I've sat and listened to
your talk of Babylon, the king, his nobles.

802
01:18:53,171 --> 01:18:57,550
Even in your troubled sleep, the words
you spoke drew a picture of twisted men

803
01:18:57,654 --> 01:19:00,157
to whom wheat stands higher
than a man's life.

804
01:19:00,261 --> 01:19:01,825
Who else opposes Alexander?

805
01:19:01,929 --> 01:19:04,745
- Who else should?
- Every man who hates tyranny.

806
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:07,977
Which do you hate most,
tyranny or Alexander?

807
01:19:10,271 --> 01:19:13,295
- Those words are strange.
- This empire for which you fight

808
01:19:13,504 --> 01:19:16,423
is old and corrupt and begs destruction.

809
01:19:16,527 --> 01:19:21,428
- The world we live in begs destruction.
- No. It needs a new force, a new idea.

810
01:19:21,532 --> 01:19:24,348
And that idea has come to Asia,
as it came to Greece.

811
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:28,727
And like Greece, it's here.
You see it, but you don't understand it.

812
01:19:29,248 --> 01:19:30,187
Alexander.

813
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:33,836
I am both Persian and Greek,
and I know both worlds.

814
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:37,590
Perhaps the Athens in which
we believe is old and corrupt, too,

815
01:19:37,799 --> 01:19:41,031
but its ideas and glories
are worth keeping alive.

816
01:19:41,135 --> 01:19:44,263
Whose glories? Athens' or Alexander's?

817
01:19:44,368 --> 01:19:49,581
Both, if needs be. A Persian victory
will not do this. Alexander's will.

818
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:53,231
If you could not see it when he spoke
in Athens, you must see it now.

819
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:56,463
Did you, when you
went into exile with me?

820
01:19:57,402 --> 01:19:59,383
- I wasn't sure.
- But you went.

821
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:02,719
- I am your wife.
- That's a word in your heart?

822
01:20:04,075 --> 01:20:06,473
- You ask me that now?
- Yes, now.

823
01:20:06,577 --> 01:20:10,644
For I believe he's never left
either your mind or your heart, has he?

824
01:20:15,753 --> 01:20:18,152
- It's a bitter farewell.
- Memnon...

825
01:20:19,924 --> 01:20:22,427
For you, Memnon, I plead for you.

826
01:21:17,899 --> 01:21:22,278
At Troy, Achilles found
his Hector and killed him.

827
01:21:23,321 --> 01:21:25,719
Who will be my Hector?

828
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:31,350
To the god of battles!

829
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:55,019
Charge!

830
01:23:31,783 --> 01:23:33,660
(Cleitus) Alexander! Duck!

831
01:24:14,638 --> 01:24:17,558
You treacherous,
murderous Persian dogs!

832
01:24:31,947 --> 01:24:33,824
We ask for quarter.

833
01:24:34,762 --> 01:24:38,933
Every Greek in the world was pledged by
sacred oath not to take arms against me.

834
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:43,000
- I gave no such oath.
- But you were bound by it, like your men.

835
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:49,047
We now stand on the field of battle -
you the victor, we the vanquished.

836
01:24:49,152 --> 01:24:52,801
No. I as captain general of all Greece,

837
01:24:52,905 --> 01:24:55,721
and you as traitor to your people.

838
01:24:55,825 --> 01:24:58,849
Not for myself but for my men,
again I ask for quarter.

839
01:24:58,953 --> 01:25:02,290
Ask it of the Persians, who deserted you.

840
01:25:03,124 --> 01:25:05,209
How will you celebrate this victory?

841
01:25:05,418 --> 01:25:09,693
At Chaeronea your father danced over the
bodies of Greeks who fought for freedom.

842
01:25:09,797 --> 01:25:11,674
Freedom?

843
01:25:11,778 --> 01:25:15,741
You fight for pay! Earn it!

844
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:19,807
Then let it be to the death.

845
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:58,179
Of all the Greeks who fought at Granicus,
no one escaped alive.

846
01:26:13,194 --> 01:26:16,531
This, Alexander,
is the legend of the Gordian knot.

847
01:26:17,156 --> 01:26:20,180
In many years past,
when we were sorely pressed,

848
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:23,830
it was said that a king
would arrive in a village cart

849
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:26,645
who would help us and become our ruler.

850
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:29,982
This came about.
And the king was Gordius,

851
01:26:30,086 --> 01:26:33,423
who left his cart here, as it stands,
with this message:

852
01:26:33,631 --> 01:26:38,323
That anyone who could unravel this knot
would become ruler of Asia.

853
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:41,347
Many have tried.

854
01:26:41,451 --> 01:26:44,163
All have failed.

855
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:38,175
(man) Ephesus, Sardis, Helicarnassus.

856
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:42,346
He is cutting off the Persian fleet from
every port along the coast of Asia Minor.

857
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:46,099
Alexander's turning
the Aegean Sea into a Greek lake!

858
01:28:55,648 --> 01:28:57,629
Alexander, your wound!

859
01:29:00,445 --> 01:29:02,530
These Greeks to Macedonia,

860
01:29:02,634 --> 01:29:05,971
to till the soil and work in the mines
to the end of their days.

861
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:09,099
The entire population
to be sold into slavery.

862
01:29:09,203 --> 01:29:11,810
And you, Athenians,

863
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:16,190
you citizens of the capital of the world,
you representatives of its culture,

864
01:29:16,398 --> 01:29:21,090
you dignitaries, emissaries, whom I find
in Persia still conspiring with Darius

865
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:23,489
as you did against my father,

866
01:29:23,593 --> 01:29:27,764
you will be held with us
as hostages for Athens' fickle favours.

867
01:29:27,972 --> 01:29:33,081
Do you think to win her favour by what
you did at Miletus or Zeleia or Granicus?

868
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:36,314
Do you think those at home
will ever forget such savagery?

869
01:29:36,522 --> 01:29:40,902
And for those of us who might have come
over to you, we have had our warning.

870
01:29:41,527 --> 01:29:44,551
Against you it must be to the death!

871
01:29:48,514 --> 01:29:50,599
Yours the victory,

872
01:29:50,808 --> 01:29:55,395
yours... the spoils.

873
01:30:23,861 --> 01:30:27,719
You will be treated...
according to your rank.

874
01:30:35,018 --> 01:30:37,312
- Barsine.
- Alexander, conqueror!

875
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:38,981
- Is he?
- That's for you to say.

876
01:30:39,085 --> 01:30:40,649
- No, you.
- You sacked a city.

877
01:30:40,753 --> 01:30:41,900
- Look at me.
- Burned it.

878
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:45,237
- Look at me!
- Looted, pillaged, taken a woman.

879
01:30:45,341 --> 01:30:47,531
What do you expect to see?

880
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:50,763
- What I saw in your eyes when I awoke.
- Because you want it so?

881
01:30:50,972 --> 01:30:55,455
- What I saw in your eyes in Athens.
- There I betrayed Memnon with my soul.

882
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:00,148
Here at Miletus, Alexander must be loved.

883
01:31:00,252 --> 01:31:04,736
And where is Alexander's love? "You will
be treated according to your rank"!

884
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,864
- I did not mean...
- Those were your words!

885
01:31:08,698 --> 01:31:12,869
My rank is hers.
I will share both her glory and her shame.

886
01:31:13,911 --> 01:31:15,893
(whispers) Alexander!

887
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,812
What?

888
01:31:20,793 --> 01:31:24,443
- I did not speak.
- Your lips formed words.

889
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:32,367
What do you now fear to say
that you did not fear to say last night?

890
01:31:33,827 --> 01:31:37,581
What thoughts drive
through your storm-tossed brain?

891
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:40,083
Thoughts?

892
01:31:40,188 --> 01:31:41,960
Storm-tossed?

893
01:31:43,316 --> 01:31:45,297
You chose to go.

894
01:31:46,965 --> 01:31:48,842
Go.

895
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:53,326
My head turns.

896
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:55,307
It swims.

897
01:31:55,516 --> 01:31:58,539
And why must you
always choose to be alone?

898
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:04,587
Alexander... now look at me.

899
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:16,578
These were found on the battlefield.

900
01:32:20,645 --> 01:32:24,503
From Demosthenes... to Darius.

901
01:32:24,607 --> 01:32:30,759
We need wait for the Athenian fleet no
longer. Let's face it here, now, in Miletus.

902
01:32:30,863 --> 01:32:34,826
Athens is not with us, neither is Greece.
We have been betrayed!

903
01:32:35,034 --> 01:32:37,537
- Betrayed.
- It's over.

904
01:32:37,745 --> 01:32:41,499
- Whose voice do you speak with?
- I speak for myself.

905
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:43,897
- The quarrel is not here.
- The issue is.

906
01:32:44,106 --> 01:32:46,400
It has not been stated.

907
01:32:46,504 --> 01:32:50,779
I see it in all your eyes...
and your thoughts:

908
01:32:51,718 --> 01:32:54,116
"Turn back. Turn back."

909
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:58,078
There is nothing in my eyes, nor in
my thoughts, that is not on my tongue.

910
01:32:58,182 --> 01:33:00,998
Nor ever will there be.
Command, and I'll follow.

911
01:33:01,102 --> 01:33:06,420
That is not enough. You're Macedonians,
not Persian slaves. I want your hearts!

912
01:33:06,524 --> 01:33:11,738
You propose to go on - without
the Athenian fleet, without support,

913
01:33:11,842 --> 01:33:16,326
with a lifeline that stretches back more
than a thousand leagues into Macedonia.

914
01:33:16,534 --> 01:33:18,828
This is what your father would have done.

915
01:33:18,932 --> 01:33:21,018
He would have left a garrison here,

916
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:25,814
taken back the spoils to Macedonia
in what little fleet we have left,

917
01:33:25,918 --> 01:33:31,966
forced Athens into supporting us, then
invaded with an army five times as strong.

918
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:34,156
This your father would have done!

919
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:38,014
My father! My father! My father!

920
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:40,621
I am Alexander, not my father!

921
01:33:53,863 --> 01:33:58,868
The hand that plunged the dagger into my
father's body was the hand of my friend.

922
01:33:59,077 --> 01:34:01,266
And I slew my friend.

923
01:34:01,475 --> 01:34:02,935
Mine the sin, too.

924
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:05,020
The crown is mine
by right of birth, isn't it?

925
01:34:05,124 --> 01:34:08,357
? Philip the Barbarian
Philip the Barbarian

926
01:34:08,461 --> 01:34:11,693
And nothing can stand in the way
of Alexander's destiny, can it?

927
01:34:11,798 --> 01:34:15,968
What's man's fate is man's fate,
both yours and mine.

928
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:37,657
Macedonians, I am disbanding our fleet

929
01:34:37,865 --> 01:34:41,202
and sending it back
to Macedonian shores.

930
01:34:41,411 --> 01:34:47,563
We came here to Asia to conquer,
to win... or to die.

931
01:34:49,544 --> 01:34:52,776
Do you need further words from me?

932
01:34:57,885 --> 01:35:02,161
You Greeks in chains,
who fought for Persian pay,

933
01:35:02,786 --> 01:35:07,270
are free to go back to your homes
or to serve under me as you choose.

934
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:12,171
For it is your birthright as Greeks
to live under no tyranny,

935
01:35:12,379 --> 01:35:15,507
but as free men with a free choice.

936
01:35:17,905 --> 01:35:21,868
You, too, are free
to go back to Athens, if you wish,

937
01:35:21,972 --> 01:35:25,100
as I no longer need Athens.

938
01:35:25,621 --> 01:35:30,835
For if she will not lead in this holy war,
then she must follow.

939
01:35:31,252 --> 01:35:34,589
For I will embrace in my cause any man -

940
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:40,011
Greek, Carian, Lydian, lonian -
who believes in it.

941
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:19,217
Greece is where you are.

942
01:36:19,321 --> 01:36:21,302
Where you walk.

943
01:36:21,406 --> 01:36:25,890
Where you talk, breathe, live.

944
01:36:35,483 --> 01:36:38,194
To Alexander, write:

945
01:36:39,654 --> 01:36:41,531
Every nation of Asia have I,

946
01:36:41,635 --> 01:36:45,284
Darius the Persian, king of kings,
king of lands of every tongue,

947
01:36:45,493 --> 01:36:48,308
ordered to be assembled
on the plains of Babylon.

948
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:53,626
Such an army as the world has never
seen before stands against you.

949
01:36:54,148 --> 01:36:56,963
Therefore, we command you,
withdraw and return.

950
01:36:57,171 --> 01:37:00,508
Go back to the bosom
of your mother Olympias.

951
01:37:00,717 --> 01:37:03,845
For you are still an impudent
and shameless boy,

952
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:06,660
who in your madness
and ignorance have come to Asia

953
01:37:06,764 --> 01:37:10,414
with your band of robbers to do mischief.

954
01:37:10,518 --> 01:37:16,357
I send you a whip, a ball and
a bag of gold. The whip to train you.

955
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:19,381
The ball so that you may play
with boys of your own age

956
01:37:19,485 --> 01:37:23,552
and not meddle in the affairs of men.
And the gold for expenses.

957
01:37:23,656 --> 01:37:25,950
For I have heard that you are poor,

958
01:37:26,054 --> 01:37:29,287
and since I have gold
as abundant as the sunlight,

959
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:32,936
you need not come to Asia
as a thief to steal it.

960
01:37:37,211 --> 01:37:42,842
You should not have informed us
of your vast amounts of gold and silver,

961
01:37:43,051 --> 01:37:47,326
because now we will fight harder
until all your possessions are ours.

962
01:37:47,951 --> 01:37:51,705
Nor have called me "thief" and "boy",

963
01:37:51,809 --> 01:37:55,459
for if you slay me,
it will not be accounted a great triumph,

964
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:59,213
because you will have slain
merely a robber chief.

965
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:04,218
But if I slay you, which I intend to do,

966
01:38:04,426 --> 01:38:08,180
it will be said that
this great king and warrior

967
01:38:08,284 --> 01:38:14,019
died by the hand of a little Greek boy.

968
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:18,398
For I am coming against you,

969
01:38:18,503 --> 01:38:22,674
and, having entrusted myself
to the immortal gods,

970
01:38:22,882 --> 01:38:24,863
I shall be victorious over you.

971
01:39:24,819 --> 01:39:26,592
Does he make camp?

972
01:39:26,696 --> 01:39:32,118
Half a league from here they stand at
arms, no baggage train, no tents pitched.

973
01:39:32,327 --> 01:39:35,142
He will attack soon, within this night.

974
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:36,914
And we?

975
01:39:37,019 --> 01:39:39,938
We will wait.

976
01:39:40,043 --> 01:39:42,754
Order each man to stand at arms
all through the night

977
01:39:42,962 --> 01:39:45,465
and to raise his voice in loud battle cries.

978
01:39:56,726 --> 01:39:58,916
(soldiers shouting)

979
01:40:17,163 --> 01:40:19,144
(shouting continues)

980
01:40:35,098 --> 01:40:37,809
(distant shouting)

981
01:40:55,326 --> 01:40:57,933
40,000 horse. Nearly a million infantry.

982
01:40:58,037 --> 01:41:00,540
200 chariots, with scythes
to cut horses' hooves.

983
01:41:00,748 --> 01:41:02,625
Pits dug as traps for our cavalry.

984
01:41:02,729 --> 01:41:04,815
- 1500 bowmen.
- Will the Persian move?

985
01:41:04,919 --> 01:41:07,734
- He hugs the earth like a child its mother.
- Make camp.

986
01:41:07,839 --> 01:41:12,844
Make camp? Attack now, under cover
of night. In the dark there is confusion.

987
01:41:13,052 --> 01:41:15,555
On both sides, Parmenio.

988
01:41:15,659 --> 01:41:20,143
I will not steal a victory. If I am to be
destroyed, let it be by the light of day.

989
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:22,332
Tell the men to rest.

990
01:41:23,479 --> 01:41:25,565
(soldiers cheering)

991
01:41:49,339 --> 01:41:51,945
(cheering subsides)

992
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:54,031
(silence)

993
01:42:10,088 --> 01:42:13,529
Oh! An evil omen! An evil omen!

994
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:18,847
Macedonians -
disaster, destruction, death!

995
01:42:22,288 --> 01:42:24,895
It is an omen of good fortune.

996
01:42:24,999 --> 01:42:30,108
The Persian moon will be eclipsed by the
Macedonian sun. Is it not so, Aristander?

997
01:42:34,592 --> 01:42:37,095
Tell the men not to have fear.

998
01:42:38,346 --> 01:42:40,744
The heavens are on our side.

999
01:42:48,877 --> 01:42:51,380
O God of Fear,

1000
01:42:51,588 --> 01:42:56,802
to you and against failure...
I make sacrifice.

1001
01:43:01,807 --> 01:43:06,812
I now call upon all the gods
to prove to me and to all men

1002
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:09,940
that I am truly the son of heaven,

1003
01:43:10,044 --> 01:43:14,424
by giving me this day... victory.

1004
01:43:16,092 --> 01:43:22,035
This aid I beg in prayer
with outstretched arms, Ahura Mazda.

1005
01:43:22,244 --> 01:43:25,268
Grant me through righteousness
the increase of my kingdom,

1006
01:43:25,476 --> 01:43:27,666
never to be destroyed.

1007
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:31,003
Come to my support at my call.

1008
01:43:35,069 --> 01:43:38,719
You generals, companions, officers...

1009
01:43:39,657 --> 01:43:43,828
this message you will bring
to the troops under your command:

1010
01:43:45,496 --> 01:43:47,790
This is the final battle.

1011
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:51,231
This day, Greece will be revenged,

1012
01:43:51,336 --> 01:43:54,672
all Asia will be ours,
its riches in our hands,

1013
01:43:54,776 --> 01:43:57,905
and all our labours ended.

1014
01:43:58,009 --> 01:44:00,928
This, then, is the plan of battle.

1015
01:44:01,971 --> 01:44:06,663
We are outnumbered in everything
save courage and discipline.

1016
01:44:06,872 --> 01:44:12,398
But the Macedonian army is such that
even if I, Alexander, were to fall in battle,

1017
01:44:12,607 --> 01:44:15,005
only one man would be lost.

1018
01:44:15,109 --> 01:44:20,531
The Persian such that if the head
is cut off the rest of the body dies with it.

1019
01:44:21,887 --> 01:44:25,745
Therefore, Macedonians,
hold and wait.

1020
01:44:26,683 --> 01:44:28,977
Hold and wait.

1021
01:44:30,646 --> 01:44:34,608
Then, when we charge,
have but one thought:

1022
01:44:35,338 --> 01:44:38,987
Kill Darius! Kill Darius!

1023
01:44:39,092 --> 01:44:41,177
Kill Darius!

1024
01:44:45,556 --> 01:44:47,433
Charge!

1025
01:46:32,121 --> 01:46:34,102
(man shouts)

1026
01:48:25,151 --> 01:48:27,445
Darius's bow, his shield, his chariot.

1027
01:48:27,549 --> 01:48:30,990
The great king has fled! He has run away!

1028
01:48:32,033 --> 01:48:34,431
The great king has run away!

1029
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,038
(laughter and shouting)

1030
01:49:14,471 --> 01:49:18,538
So this, it seems, is royalty.

1031
01:49:49,819 --> 01:49:52,322
(weeps)

1032
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,345
My mother weeps for my father.

1033
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:59,933
Grant us this, Alexander - that we may
bury him before you put us to death.

1034
01:50:00,663 --> 01:50:03,374
Your father is alive.

1035
01:50:03,479 --> 01:50:08,379
I bear no hatred toward you
or your family, Queen.

1036
01:50:19,641 --> 01:50:22,873
He's braver than his father.
What's your name?

1037
01:50:22,977 --> 01:50:24,958
- Ochus.
- And yours?

1038
01:50:25,063 --> 01:50:27,148
Amytis.

1039
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:32,570
Roxane.

1040
01:50:33,196 --> 01:50:34,760
Roxane.

1041
01:50:52,069 --> 01:50:56,657
We will go to the north, to the
Caspian Gate, to raise another army.

1042
01:51:01,662 --> 01:51:04,686
My wife and family, how are they?

1043
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:23,871
Ha! Go on. Go on. Ha!

1044
01:51:44,830 --> 01:51:49,418
Alexander rides towards us.
He is no more than ten leagues away.

1045
01:51:49,522 --> 01:51:51,295
Abdicate.

1046
01:52:53,544 --> 01:52:55,630
Get away.

1047
01:53:14,294 --> 01:53:16,380
Get on!

1048
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:32,229
Then die, Darius, Emperor.

1049
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:37,130
Get away, quickly!

1050
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,128
- (soldier) This is how I found him.
- Did he speak?

1051
01:54:38,232 --> 01:54:42,090
- He asked for water. I gave him some.
- Did he speak?

1052
01:54:42,195 --> 01:54:47,200
Some words I did not understand well,
about destiny and fate.

1053
01:54:47,304 --> 01:54:50,015
He gave me this to give to you.

1054
01:54:50,224 --> 01:54:53,039
Then he prayed. Then he died.

1055
01:54:55,646 --> 01:55:01,276
(Alexander) "My son, Alexander,
look now what I was and what I am,

1056
01:55:01,381 --> 01:55:04,717
with no one near me
to even close my eyes."

1057
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:09,722
"Let the Macedonians and Persians
sit in mourning for me."

1058
01:55:09,931 --> 01:55:12,538
"Take my daughter, Roxane,
for your wife,

1059
01:55:12,642 --> 01:55:16,396
so that the seed of Darius
and of Philip may be mingled in her,

1060
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:19,941
and that our worlds may become as one."

1061
01:55:21,401 --> 01:55:25,467
"Into your hands... I commend my spirit."

1062
01:55:43,715 --> 01:55:46,738
(Alexander) "That our worlds
may become as one."

1063
01:55:47,573 --> 01:55:51,326
"Into your hands I commend my spirit."

1064
01:56:12,493 --> 01:56:17,498
Let the man who slew my enemy
come forward, for I seek to honour him.

1065
01:56:19,792 --> 01:56:25,840
Let him fear not, for I swear by the gods
and by the life of my mother Olympias

1066
01:56:25,944 --> 01:56:29,698
that I will make him renowned
and exalted over my troops.

1067
01:56:36,997 --> 01:56:40,542
Why did you betray, make prisoner
and finally murder Darius?

1068
01:56:40,647 --> 01:56:45,547
I did not act alone. We agreed that such
an act would win favour in your eyes.

1069
01:56:45,652 --> 01:56:49,405
And the crown of Persia which you had
the arrogance to place upon your head?

1070
01:56:49,614 --> 01:56:52,325
- You won hatred and death.
- You swore falsely!

1071
01:56:52,533 --> 01:56:54,932
No. You.

1072
01:56:55,974 --> 01:57:00,667
For he was both your lord and your
kinsman, and you swore loyalty to him.

1073
01:57:00,875 --> 01:57:05,672
I will keep my oath.
You will be exalted above my troops.

1074
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:10,781
Impaled upon a stake, and there be left
for all men to see and remember...

1075
01:57:11,615 --> 01:57:16,307
that only a king... may slay a king.

1076
01:57:34,763 --> 01:57:37,161
I weep, friends.

1077
01:57:37,266 --> 01:57:42,062
I weep for all those Greeks
who did not live long enough

1078
01:57:42,166 --> 01:57:46,546
to see such a sight
as Alexander on the throne of Darius.

1079
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:49,465
For Ptolemy, a throne, too.

1080
01:57:49,674 --> 01:57:54,366
Thrones for all of you,
for all of you shall be kings.

1081
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:58,537
Hephaestion, Nearchus, Harpalus,

1082
01:57:58,641 --> 01:58:04,480
all my companions,
generals, soldiers - kings, all of you.

1083
01:58:05,315 --> 01:58:07,296
Ask and it's yours.

1084
01:58:07,504 --> 01:58:13,031
Gold, silver, spices,
jewels, slaves, women - yours.

1085
01:58:13,969 --> 01:58:16,367
Cleitus! Where's Cleitus?

1086
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:20,434
- Cleitus is drunk.
- And has what he needs.

1087
01:58:20,538 --> 01:58:22,623
(laughter)

1088
01:58:23,875 --> 01:58:28,254
I, too, like Alexander,
give to you everything I've gained.

1089
01:58:28,463 --> 01:58:31,278
For I, too, like Alexander,
am rich enough in glory.

1090
01:58:31,382 --> 01:58:35,240
My son, to make yourself
less great would be far better.

1091
01:58:35,345 --> 01:58:40,662
To my king,
Alexander of Macedonia, son of Philip,

1092
01:58:40,767 --> 01:58:46,189
who led us here and will lead us safely
home again victorious conquerors.

1093
01:58:54,739 --> 01:58:57,659
(man) The war is over! Darius is dead!

1094
01:59:05,375 --> 01:59:10,067
The city burns!
Our soldiers have set fire to the city.

1095
01:59:10,275 --> 01:59:12,569
Look, it's burning. Look!

1096
01:59:13,925 --> 01:59:16,114
Look, it's on fire! It burns.

1097
01:59:16,219 --> 01:59:21,119
As should this palace, a symbol to
all the world that the holy war is ended,

1098
01:59:21,328 --> 01:59:26,437
that the Persian Empire is no more,
that Alexander has revenged Greece.

1099
01:59:27,793 --> 01:59:31,442
Women, who followed the camp
of Alexander all over Asia

1100
01:59:31,651 --> 01:59:34,466
and dreamed of this day
when we should return to Greece,

1101
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:38,011
shall I, Barsine,
throw the first torch for you?

1102
01:59:38,116 --> 01:59:41,140
Or will you, Alexander, throw it for us?

1103
02:00:03,453 --> 02:00:05,435
No.

1104
02:00:05,643 --> 02:00:07,416
No. Put them out.

1105
02:00:07,624 --> 02:00:10,335
Put the flames out! It's my palace!

1106
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,942
My palace! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1107
02:00:16,487 --> 02:00:18,677
It must not be said of Alexander

1108
02:00:18,886 --> 02:00:22,535
that wherever he passed only charred
ruins remain as his monument.

1109
02:00:22,952 --> 02:00:26,497
It will be said of Alexander
what he has always wanted said.

1110
02:00:26,706 --> 02:00:30,355
You think me too drunk not to know
that you, too, seek to betray me?

1111
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:33,796
- Betray?
- Either that, or you cannot understand.

1112
02:00:33,901 --> 02:00:37,654
- I understand too well.
- What?

1113
02:00:37,759 --> 02:00:40,470
The fire that burns inside you,
put that out, too.

1114
02:00:40,574 --> 02:00:43,911
- That's heaven's fire.
- Alexander, let there be an end.

1115
02:00:44,119 --> 02:00:47,456
- Why? So that you can hold me chained?
- Yes.

1116
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:51,105
- Is this the degree of your love?
- My love has no degree.

1117
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:53,295
You fear I'll leave you for another woman.

1118
02:00:53,399 --> 02:00:56,215
No other woman is my rival
except your mother,

1119
02:00:56,423 --> 02:00:59,447
and your frenzied desire
to outdo your father!

1120
02:01:01,428 --> 02:01:04,973
I am not Philip's son.
I am the son of God.

1121
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:09,978
The world is my domain,

1122
02:01:10,083 --> 02:01:13,211
and my mission is to rule it and rebuild it.

1123
02:01:14,671 --> 02:01:18,424
We will march to the end of the world.

1124
02:01:18,633 --> 02:01:21,240
It's men who must follow you, not gods.

1125
02:01:21,344 --> 02:01:25,098
Men will. All men will!

1126
02:01:33,961 --> 02:01:35,733
Athenians!

1127
02:01:35,838 --> 02:01:40,425
Alexander asks that we now
formally proclaim him a god,

1128
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:42,719
son of Zeus Ammon.

1129
02:01:43,241 --> 02:01:46,682
"O Athenians, when will you see
your days of glory again?"

1130
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:49,601
Demosthenes once asked.

1131
02:01:49,914 --> 02:01:53,772
Well, now you have your answer - never!

1132
02:01:53,876 --> 02:01:56,692
Alexander, who could
have conquered for us,

1133
02:01:56,796 --> 02:02:01,488
but now conquers for himself
and stands master of two worlds -

1134
02:02:01,697 --> 02:02:03,678
Europe and Asia!

1135
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:08,787
In ten short years
he has conquered the world.

1136
02:02:09,726 --> 02:02:13,479
He has fought his way
2,000 miles to Babylon.

1137
02:02:13,584 --> 02:02:16,920
Miletus, Sidon, Tyre...

1138
02:02:17,859 --> 02:02:21,195
all these great cities
have fallen before him.

1139
02:02:21,404 --> 02:02:24,011
He has entered Egypt.
He has crossed the Euphrates.

1140
02:02:24,115 --> 02:02:29,850
Babylon, Persepolis, Susa -
all are his treasure houses.

1141
02:02:30,058 --> 02:02:35,168
He has done away with Darius, and made
himself king of kings over all his domain.

1142
02:02:36,210 --> 02:02:41,320
Master of two worlds, he has achieved
what no man has achieved in history.

1143
02:02:42,779 --> 02:02:45,803
And now he has crossed
into the lands of India.

1144
02:02:45,908 --> 02:02:49,661
He has gone further than
any man or god before him.

1145
02:02:49,766 --> 02:02:52,268
He has conquered man.

1146
02:02:52,477 --> 02:02:55,605
He has outdone the gods!

1147
02:02:55,709 --> 02:02:59,671
Make the resolution, Demosthenes.
Proclaim him a god.

1148
02:03:04,364 --> 02:03:07,283
Proclaim Alexander a god!

1149
02:03:09,994 --> 02:03:14,686
Why should the blood of thousands be
shed to gratify the ambition of one man,

1150
02:03:14,791 --> 02:03:19,379
who has disowned his father and
insanely affects kinship with the gods?

1151
02:03:28,346 --> 02:03:30,953
This I've heard the soldiers say.

1152
02:03:31,057 --> 02:03:33,559
You will proceed to Ecbatana.

1153
02:03:33,664 --> 02:03:38,669
You will take command, to ensure our
lines of communication against attack.

1154
02:03:38,773 --> 02:03:40,858
Farewell, Parmenio.

1155
02:03:52,537 --> 02:03:57,855
Philotas, you are under arrest...
for high treason.

1156
02:03:57,959 --> 02:04:00,983
No more. No more.

1157
02:04:01,191 --> 02:04:03,694
Whatever you want me to say, I'll say.

1158
02:04:05,049 --> 02:04:08,073
It's true, I plotted against you.

1159
02:04:11,097 --> 02:04:13,704
(groans)

1160
02:04:13,808 --> 02:04:16,728
I and my father Parmenio!

1161
02:05:14,911 --> 02:05:17,935
For your pleasure, great king,

1162
02:05:18,143 --> 02:05:22,627
a contest of skill between
a Macedonian and a Persian.

1163
02:05:25,129 --> 02:05:28,570
20 gold talents, the province of Bactria -

1164
02:05:28,779 --> 02:05:31,386
my king has been very generous to me...

1165
02:05:31,490 --> 02:05:35,869
I'll wager it all against
one of your Persian robes,

1166
02:05:35,974 --> 02:05:38,059
which I, too, must now learn to wear,

1167
02:05:38,267 --> 02:05:42,960
that my Macedonian there can beat
any Persian that you bring against him.

1168
02:05:43,064 --> 02:05:45,879
Come, Persians, will you wager?
Will you fight?

1169
02:05:46,088 --> 02:05:48,799
- Will you hold your tongue?
- No.

1170
02:05:49,007 --> 02:05:52,240
That's for slaves to do, not free men.

1171
02:05:52,448 --> 02:05:54,847
Either I am that,
or do not invite me to dine.

1172
02:05:54,951 --> 02:05:57,975
Or drink, for the wine
has gone to your head.

1173
02:05:58,079 --> 02:06:03,292
Your father, Philip,
won many battles as drunk as Dionysus.

1174
02:06:07,151 --> 02:06:09,236
Send in your man.

1175
02:06:38,849 --> 02:06:41,873
- Let him live.
- No. Let him die,

1176
02:06:41,977 --> 02:06:44,897
as have so many Macedonians, by order!

1177
02:06:45,105 --> 02:06:49,172
- Cleitus, brother.
- Can I be a brother to a god?

1178
02:06:49,380 --> 02:06:53,030
It is by the blood of Macedonians
that you have grown so great.

1179
02:06:53,134 --> 02:06:57,722
- We were the victors, not the Persians.
- There are no victors nor vanquished.

1180
02:06:57,930 --> 02:07:01,267
There are vanquished. All those
who came with you are vanquished.

1181
02:07:01,371 --> 02:07:04,187
If you cannot hold your tongue, go!

1182
02:07:04,395 --> 02:07:08,879
Your tongue is thick with wine, too.
Is that seemly for the king of kings?

1183
02:07:09,296 --> 02:07:12,216
Cleitus is dismissed by Alexander!

1184
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:15,552
- In heaven's name, go!
- No, till I've had my say.

1185
02:07:15,657 --> 02:07:19,306
Then stand on your drunken feet,
if you can, and say it!

1186
02:07:19,410 --> 02:07:23,685
You cast aside every man
who's helped you, even your father.

1187
02:07:25,667 --> 02:07:27,960
I?

1188
02:07:28,169 --> 02:07:31,923
- I saved his life at Chaeronea.
- I saved yours at Granicus.

1189
02:07:32,131 --> 02:07:34,738
- He bore me a grudge for this.
- As you bear me one.

1190
02:07:34,947 --> 02:07:37,762
As you do to any man who
might throw a shadow on your glory.

1191
02:07:37,971 --> 02:07:40,786
There is no man alive
who can throw a shadow on my glory.

1192
02:07:40,890 --> 02:07:44,957
There are dead men who can, and do!
Philip, Attalus, Parmenio.

1193
02:07:45,165 --> 02:07:48,815
- These words are little short of treason!
- They are not short of truth.

1194
02:07:49,023 --> 02:07:52,464
Let those who will bow before
your Persian robes and throne,

1195
02:07:52,568 --> 02:07:55,279
and accept that you have
disclaimed your father

1196
02:07:55,488 --> 02:07:57,991
and pass yourself off as the son of God!

1197
02:08:03,934 --> 02:08:08,939
Let go of me! Am I Darius,
to be held prisoner by my friends?

1198
02:08:09,148 --> 02:08:10,920
Let go!

1199
02:08:15,299 --> 02:08:19,262
"Are these your customs? Is it thus
that Greece rewards her heroes?"

1200
02:08:19,366 --> 02:08:21,869
"Shall one man claim
the trophies won by thousands?"

1201
02:08:22,077 --> 02:08:24,788
I quote from Euripides,
your favourite poet,

1202
02:08:24,892 --> 02:08:28,750
as did Pausanias and your mother,
before Philip's murder!

1203
02:08:29,689 --> 02:08:31,983
Go now!

1204
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,173
To Philip,

1205
02:08:37,092 --> 02:08:38,865
Attalus...

1206
02:08:40,742 --> 02:08:43,140
and Parmenio.

1207
02:09:26,829 --> 02:09:29,436
Cleitus, brother!

1208
02:09:30,166 --> 02:09:32,460
Cleitus, brother!

1209
02:09:32,564 --> 02:09:36,839
Is this Alexander,
who cries because he has killed a man?

1210
02:09:37,048 --> 02:09:41,740
Can this be he, who lies there, crying in
fear of the law and of the tongues of men,

1211
02:09:41,844 --> 02:09:46,537
when he himself is the law
and the measure of right and wrong?

1212
02:09:46,641 --> 02:09:49,873
Whatever is done
by supreme power is right.

1213
02:09:51,124 --> 02:09:53,001
These are words.

1214
02:09:53,106 --> 02:09:56,755
And Cleitus is dead, and I killed him.

1215
02:10:12,709 --> 02:10:16,358
We will go back, Macedonians.

1216
02:10:19,590 --> 02:10:21,780
And I, Ptolemy,

1217
02:10:22,197 --> 02:10:25,638
companion of Alexander,
later Pharaoh of Egypt,

1218
02:10:26,681 --> 02:10:29,913
bear witness to the terrible return
from India to Babylon.

1219
02:10:39,923 --> 02:10:43,468
For the first time in the ten years
since he left Macedonia,

1220
02:10:43,573 --> 02:10:46,909
Alexander, sick and weary, retreated.

1221
02:10:48,161 --> 02:10:51,393
But he turned even
this retreat into victory.

1222
02:10:51,602 --> 02:10:54,938
For within him, out of the death of Cleitus,

1223
02:10:55,147 --> 02:10:59,735
a new idea was born, a new
understanding, a new driving force -

1224
02:11:00,673 --> 02:11:05,365
that it was not lands that must be
conquered, but the hearts of men.

1225
02:11:06,408 --> 02:11:10,058
And at the end of the thirsty road,
at Susa,

1226
02:11:10,162 --> 02:11:14,124
Alexander pledged himself
and us to this new idea.

1227
02:11:14,958 --> 02:11:18,191
(priest) Make this union fruitful
as the seeds of the earth,

1228
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:22,049
and let the children of Alexander, a Greek,
and Roxane, a Persian,

1229
02:11:22,257 --> 02:11:25,073
be of both worlds and live in one.

1230
02:11:36,021 --> 02:11:39,358
(priests) And let this be true
of all you Greeks and Persians

1231
02:11:39,462 --> 02:11:42,694
who are married here this day at Susa.

1232
02:11:43,633 --> 02:11:47,491
And let this be true
of all you Greeks and Persians

1233
02:11:47,595 --> 02:11:51,557
who are married here this day at Susa.

1234
02:11:51,766 --> 02:11:55,624
And let this be true
of all you Greeks and Persians

1235
02:11:55,728 --> 02:11:57,918
who are married here this day...

1236
02:11:58,022 --> 02:12:00,108
(fanfare)

1237
02:12:18,981 --> 02:12:24,924
To you, you men and women with whom
I have lived and with whom I have died -

1238
02:12:25,133 --> 02:12:28,365
Philip, Eurydice,
Parmenio, Philotas, Darius...

1239
02:12:29,825 --> 02:12:33,162
and Cleitus... my brother -

1240
02:12:35,143 --> 02:12:37,124
I offer this prayer.

1241
02:12:49,428 --> 02:12:53,077
And to you for peace I pray,

1242
02:12:53,182 --> 02:12:55,476
that Macedonians and Persians

1243
02:12:55,580 --> 02:12:58,499
and all the people of my empire
will always be alike.

1244
02:12:58,708 --> 02:13:02,253
Not merely subjects, but people
who will live and build together

1245
02:13:02,462 --> 02:13:05,694
in harmony and unity
of heart and of mind.

1246
02:13:05,798 --> 02:13:08,822
For we are all alike under God.

1247
02:13:08,926 --> 02:13:14,140
And if God is the father,
then he is the father of all.

1248
02:13:20,083 --> 02:13:21,960
No.

1249
02:13:22,899 --> 02:13:24,463
Oh, no.

1250
02:13:25,297 --> 02:13:28,217
No, no. Not yet.

1251
02:13:29,989 --> 02:13:32,387
There is still so much to do.

1252
02:13:53,137 --> 02:13:54,910
Barsine.

1253
02:14:01,896 --> 02:14:03,982
Man's fate.

1254
02:14:05,233 --> 02:14:07,840
You gods,

1255
02:14:07,944 --> 02:14:13,157
have I not done enough
in this short span of life to sit among you?

1256
02:14:14,409 --> 02:14:17,120
Must I be cursed with man's fate?

1257
02:14:19,622 --> 02:14:22,646
Barsine, after I am dead,

1258
02:14:22,750 --> 02:14:27,860
see to it that my body is carried out
and cast into the River Euphrates,

1259
02:14:27,964 --> 02:14:30,988
so that it may disappear,

1260
02:14:31,092 --> 02:14:36,618
that men will forever believe
that from the gods I came...

1261
02:14:38,495 --> 02:14:42,875
and to the gods... I returned.

1262
02:14:51,425 --> 02:14:54,553
To whom do you leave your empire?

1263
02:15:04,563 --> 02:15:09,464
To... the strongest.

1264
02:15:21,038 --> 02:15:26,460
(Aristotle) Wonders are many, but none
is more wonderful than man himself.
