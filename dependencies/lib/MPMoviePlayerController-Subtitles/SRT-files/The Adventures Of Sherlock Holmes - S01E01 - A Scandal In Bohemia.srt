1
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,378
Psst!

2
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,466
Got you!

3
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,651
Now look here...

4
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,408
But mum!

5
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,579
Close the window, John.

6
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:21,642
To Sherlock Holmes,
she was always "the woman,"

7
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:27,773
the beautiful Irena Adler of
dubious and questionable memory.

8
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,878
At the time of our involvement
in the Irena Adler case,

9
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,714
Holmes and I had been sharing
rooms in Baker Street

10
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,217
for some years.

11
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,345
My practice had caused me
to be absent in the country

12
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,305
for several days.

13
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,643
As usual, after leaving
Holmes for any length of time,

14
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:09,815
I returned filled with
apprehension as to his mood.

15
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,029
Oh!

16
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,656
Oh, hello, Mrs. Hudson.

17
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,494
Dr. Watson, just look at you,
half soaked to the skin!

18
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,412
Yes, well,
I am not surprised,

19
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,707
I have just spent 20 minutes
standing in the pouring rain

20
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:27,416
waiting for a cab.

21
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,793
It won't do that
old wound of yours any good

22
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,503
getting so wet, Doctor.

23
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,337
I know.

24
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,423
I'll just take this
coat and your hat

25
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,049
and see that
they're properly dried.

26
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,219
Mrs. Hudson,
I haven't eaten all day.

27
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,221
I do hope supper
will be up very soon.

28
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,931
That's very doubtful.

29
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,558
I don't know what's
come over Mr. Holmes,

30
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,393
he seems to be
all on edge.

31
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,313
I'm not to bring up supper
until I'm called.

32
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,065
Those are his orders.

33
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,651
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

34
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,443
My dear Holmes,

35
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:50,249
what is it tonight,
morphine or cocaine?

36
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,877
Well, I can
strongly recommend

37
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:59,967
a seven percent solution
of cocaine.

38
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,636
Would you care to try it?

39
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,556
No, indeed!

40
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,141
I speak not only as your friend,
but as a medical man.

41
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:12,646
How can you risk such damage
to the great powers

42
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,107
with which you have
been endowed?!

43
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,607
I cannot tell you

44
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,776
how it clarifies
and stimulates the mind.

45
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,321
Yes, and destroys it in time!

46
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:28,829
My mind rebels
at stagnation.

47
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:33,625
Give me problems,
give me work,

48
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,419
give me the most
abstruse cryptogram,

49
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:40,591
the most intricate analysis,
and I'm in my proper atmosphere.

50
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:45,345
Then I can dispense
with artificial stimulants.

51
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:49,766
But I abhor the dull routine
of existence.

52
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:54,688
I crave mental exultation.

53
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,857
That is why I have chosen
my own profession,

54
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,276
or rather created it,

55
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,863
for I am the only one
in the world.

56
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,699
The only unofficial detective.

57
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,660
The only unofficial
consulting detective.

58
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,913
I take no credit in my cases.

59
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:11,705
The work itself,

60
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,374
the pleasure of finding a field
for my particular powers

61
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,461
is my highest reward.

62
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,636
You can close that drawer.

63
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:29,014
You have made the wrong
diagnosis, Doctor!

64
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:34,436
I have my stimulant here.

65
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,818
I hope you enjoyed your week
in the country.

66
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,612
It was good
for the appetite.

67
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,658
Incidentally, I do wish
you would ring for supper.

68
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,913
What is this?

69
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,083
Yes, I must get ready
for my visitor.

70
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,212
It came by
the morning post.

71
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,592
Give me your observations.

72
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:10,681
Well, it's undated and without
either signature or address.

73
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:14,518
Good, read it aloud.

74
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,520
"Dear Mr. Holmes:

75
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,815
There will call upon you tonight
at a quarter to eight

76
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,859
a gentleman who"--

77
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,527
good heavens, we've only
a few minutes, Holmes.

78
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,280
Go on.

79
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,365
"A gentleman who desires
to consult with you

80
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,410
upon a matter of
the very deepest moment.

81
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,620
Your recent services to one
of the royal houses of Europe

82
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,622
have shown that you are one
who may be safely trusted

83
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,167
with matters which
are of an importance

84
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,170
which can hardly
be exaggerated.

85
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:45,465
This account of you we have
from all quarters received,

86
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,051
be in your chamber then."

87
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,721
Good--good heavens,
this is a mystery, indeed.

88
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,139
What do you
imagine it means?

89
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,557
I have no data yet.

90
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,226
It is a capital mistake
to theorize before one has data.

91
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:56,727
Mm.

92
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:57,853
But the note itself,

93
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,148
what do you
deduce from it?

94
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,065
It's a man's writing.

95
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,859
Good.

96
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,487
Presumably well-to-do,
it's expensive paper, this.

97
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,156
It's peculiarly
strong and stiff.

98
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,866
Peculiar,
that is the very word.

99
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,701
It is not English
paper at all.

100
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,579
Hold it up
to the light.

101
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:20,709
Ah, large E,
small g, large P, and G

102
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,129
with a small t
woven into the texture.

103
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,423
And that is?

104
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,550
Maker's monogram.

105
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,843
Excellent, Watson!

106
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,221
Come along!

107
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:37,809
Let us consult
our continental gazetteer.

108
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,687
Your cigars; you see, I was not
unmindful of your return.

109
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:41,730
Oh, Holmes!

110
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,232
Would you
care for some whiskey?

111
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,526
Later, perhaps,
when we've eaten.

112
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:49,363
The monogram is an abbreviation
for Papier Gesellschaft,

113
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,740
which is the German
for "paper company."

114
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:58,539
And the Eg,
Eglow, Eglonitz, Egria,

115
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,541
a German-speaking district
of Bohemia

116
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,584
noted for its numerous
glass factories

117
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,378
and paper mills, there.

118
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,922
Bohemia,
the kingdom of Bohemia.

119
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,966
And the note is
written by a German.

120
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,592
You see,
"this account of you

121
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,469
we have from
all quarters received,"

122
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,888
only a German is so
uncourteous to his words.

123
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:18,767
So we are to expect
a German from Bohemia.

124
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,356
Here he is,

125
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:29,736
drawn by a pair,
a nice little brougham.

126
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,239
There's money in this case,
Watson, if there's nothing else.

127
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,783
Holmes, I think your visitor
will want me out of the way.

128
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,452
Not a bit, Doctor,
stay where you are!

129
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,455
I am lost without
my Boswell.

130
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,084
But he sounded so secretive.

131
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,420
I may need your help,
and so may he.

132
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,755
Now, stay in that armchair,
and give me your full attention.

133
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,424
Here he comes.

134
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:00,434
I'm sorry, sir,

135
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,603
but you cannot come in here
unannounced like this!

136
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:06,356
Mr. Holmes does not see anybody
without appointment!

137
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,619
Oh, I'm so sorry,
Mr. Holmes!

138
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,537
There was nothing
I could do!

139
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,540
It's perfectly all right,
Mrs. Hudson!

140
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,875
If you would
kindly leave us.

141
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,459
Yes.

142
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,084
And close the door.

143
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:26,668
Of course.

144
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,463
Thank you.

145
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,726
You read my note?

146
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,394
Yes. Pray take a seat!

147
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,233
This is my friend and
colleague, Dr. Watson,

148
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,152
who is occasionally good enough
to help me in my cases!

149
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,780
How do you do, sir.

150
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,830
Who do I have
the honor to address?

151
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:08,377
You may address me as the Count
Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.

152
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,505
I should much prefer to
communicate with you alone.

153
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,299
No, it is both, or none.

154
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,551
You may say
before this gentleman

155
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,470
anything which you may wish
to say to me.

156
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:19,888
Very well, I take your word

157
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,891
that he is a man of honor
and discretion.

158
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:26,603
But I must begin by binding
you both to absolute secrecy

159
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,564
for a period of two years.

160
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,898
Indeed?

161
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:30,691
At the end of that time

162
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,818
the matter will be
of no importance.

163
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,319
At present it is
of such weight

164
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:38,448
that it may have an influence
upon European history.

165
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,787
I promise.

166
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,124
And I.

167
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,671
You will excuse this mask.

168
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,423
The august person
who employs me

169
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,676
wishes his agent
to be unknown to you.

170
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,597
In fact, I may confess that
the title I have given you

171
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,183
is not exactly my own.

172
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,895
I was aware of that.

173
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,775
The circumstances
are of great delicacy;

174
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:17,070
every precaution must be taken
to prevent an immense scandal

175
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,572
which would
seriously compromise

176
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:22,618
one of the royal houses
of Europe.

177
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,745
To speak plainly,

178
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,498
the matter concerns
the great House of Ormstein,

179
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,918
hereditary kings of Bohemia.

180
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:35,255
I was aware of that, too,
your Majesty.

181
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,478
You are right...

182
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,904
I am the King.

183
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,657
Why should I attempt
to conceal it?

184
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,243
Why, indeed?

185
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,494
Your Majesty had not spoken

186
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,496
before I was aware
that I was addressing

187
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,625
Wilhelm Gottsreich
Sigismond von Ormstein,

188
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,504
Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein,
and hereditary King of Bohemia.

189
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,091
And in passing,
the finest dualist in Europe.

190
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,301
You have killed
four opponents.

191
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,804
Honorably.

192
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,139
Of course.

193
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,190
The facts are briefly these:

194
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,984
Ah!

195
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:41,154
Some 10 years ago, during
a lengthy visit to Warsaw,

196
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,867
I made the acquaintance
of the well known adventuress,

197
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:50,372
Irena Adler.

198
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,333
The name is no doubt
familiar to you.

199
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:58,088
Kindly look her up in my index,
will you, Watson.

200
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:05,387
So, I deduce that your Majesty
became entangled with this lady,

201
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,680
wrote her some
compromising letters,

202
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,807
and is now desirous
of getting them back.

203
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,142
Precisely so.

204
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,436
But how could
you know that?

205
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:20,152
Italian general's staff...

206
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:27,576
Ah, Adler, Irena,
born New Jersey, 1858.

207
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,410
Is this the lady?

208
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,662
New Jersey, let me see.

209
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,498
Singer, contralto

210
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:36,752
appeared at La Scala, opera
houses Petersburg and Warsaw,

211
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,378
retired from
the operatic stage,

212
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,838
now living in London,

213
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,090
makes occasional
concert appearances.

214
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,092
That is the lady.

215
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,101
Was there a secret marriage?

216
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,519
None.

217
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,604
No legal papers
or certificates?

218
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:38,939
None.

219
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,774
Then I fail to follow
your Majesty.

220
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,069
If this person
should produce your letters

221
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,488
for blackmailing
or other purposes,

222
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,576
how is she to prove
their authenticity?

223
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,660
There is the writing.

224
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,662
Pooh, pooh! Forgery.

225
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,873
My private writing paper.

226
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,624
Stolen.

227
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,876
My own seal.

228
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,627
Imitated.

229
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,962
My photograph.

230
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,631
Bought.

231
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:08,260
We were both
in that photograph.

232
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,466
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

233
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,178
Yes, that is very bad.

234
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:55,349
Your Majesty has certainly
committed an indiscretion.

235
00:16:55,474 --> 00:17:03,106
She was beautiful, bewitching,
clever, daring.

236
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:01,456
I was only
Crown Prince then.

237
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,834
I was young!

238
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,753
I am but 30 now.

239
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:07,462
Of course,
your Majesty

240
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,966
has attempted to recover
the photograph?

241
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,802
We have tried and failed.

242
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,804
Then your Majesty must pay.

243
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,222
It must be bought.

244
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,932
She will not sell.

245
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,059
Stolen, then.

246
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,645
Five attempts
have been made.

247
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,482
Twice burglars in my pay
ransacked her house.

248
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,652
Once we diverted her luggage
when she traveled.

249
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,780
Twice she has
been waylaid.

250
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,200
There has been
no sign of it.

251
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:42,372
You mock?!

252
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,333
It is serious!

253
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,334
Yes.

254
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,003
Yes, it is
very serious, indeed.

255
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,130
Well, what does she propose
to do with this photograph

256
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:54,384
if not to extort money?

257
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,013
To ruin me.

258
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,890
How?

259
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,184
I'm about to be married.

260
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,977
So I've heard.

261
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,522
To the Princess Clotilde
Lothman von Saxe-Meningen,

262
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,607
and second daughter
to the King of Scandinavia.

263
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,484
It is a brilliant match.

264
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,401
Precisely.

265
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,655
But you will know the
strict principles of her family.

266
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,325
She's herself
the soul of delicacy.

267
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,244
A shadow of doubt
as to my conduct

268
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,162
would bring the matter
to an end.

269
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,213
And Irena Adler?

270
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:34,216
Threatens to send them
the photograph.

271
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,426
And she will do it.

272
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,471
She has a soul of steel.

273
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,515
She's more beautiful than
any other woman I've known,

274
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,892
more resolute
than any man.

275
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:47,396
There are no lengths to which
she would not go, none,

276
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:51,692
to prevent my marriage
to another woman!

277
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,989
Your Majesty,

278
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:02,661
why is this lady
so vindictive?

279
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:06,373
Oh, there was once
some talk of marriage.

280
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,041
Ha!

281
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:13,797
She would not see
that it was impossible!

282
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:29,021
You are sure that she has not
sent the photograph yet?

283
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,397
I am sure.

284
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,607
Why?

285
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,609
It may be on its way
at this very moment.

286
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,319
Because she has said
that she would send it

287
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:39,156
on the day when the betrothal
was publicly proclaimed.

288
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,617
That will be next Monday.

289
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,368
But I must leave London
on Friday

290
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,787
to be home
for the ceremony.

291
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:49,291
Ah, then we do
have three days.

292
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,501
Well, that is
very fortunate,

293
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:54,129
for I do have
other matters in hand.

294
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,798
Where can I find
your Majesty in London?

295
00:20:56,924 --> 00:21:00,093
At the Langham Hotel,

296
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,262
as the Count Von Kramm,
remember.

297
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:02,971
Yes, of course.

298
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,973
And as to expenditure?

299
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,861
Here are 300 pounds in gold,
and 700 in notes.

300
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:24,284
And Miss Irena Adler's address?

301
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:25,035
Goodnight, your Majesty,

302
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,541
and I trust we shall soon
have good news for you.

303
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:54,731
Holmes, we can dine
at Romano's,

304
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:58,485
but we only have three days,
till Friday.

305
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,196
Oh, it must be settled
by Friday.

306
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,155
The composer Tchaikovsky

307
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,283
is conducting his own works
at the St. James's Hall.

308
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,409
No, no, no, no!

309
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:09,163
It must be
settled by Friday.

310
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:15,169
My dear Watson,
I'd like to be alone.

311
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,003
You are hungry?

312
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,171
Yes.

313
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,381
I'm sure Mrs. Hudson will
bring you up a sandwich.

314
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,007
A sandwich?

315
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,759
We will not discuss this matter
until tomorrow afternoon.

316
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,887
Goodnight.

317
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:40,546
Better than working,
isn't it, mate?

318
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:41,588
What is?

319
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,131
Looking on.

320
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:47,219
I'll change with you
any time, gov.

321
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,388
And what
position are you?

322
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:53,725
Eight weeks,
a mere first-class groom.

323
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,811
Are ya?

324
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:58,438
Well, you can give
me a hand if you like.

325
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:03,277
I see you're all right.

326
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,945
Why not?

327
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,573
Give her the price
of the booze.

328
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:13,871
I thought
it was the booze.

329
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:20,043
Strap the mare,
show us what you can do.

330
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:52,743
I spent a couple of hours
with the cabbie and his cronies.

331
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,162
Miss Irena Adler

332
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,999
has certainly turned all
men's heads in those parts.

333
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:03,670
She is the daintiest thing
under a bonnet on this planet,

334
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:09,510
so say the Serpentine-mews
fraternity, to a man.

335
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,262
She lives quietly,

336
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,640
drives out at five
in the evening,

337
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:18,435
returns at
seven sharp for dinner.

338
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,605
Seldom goes out at other times,
except when she sings.

339
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,859
She has only one male visitor,
but sees a good deal of him.

340
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,195
He never calls less than
once a day, and often twice.

341
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:31,490
His name is a Mr. Godfrey
Norton, of the Inner Temple.

342
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:35,202
You see the advantages of having
a cabman as a confidant.

343
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:41,708
Mr. Godfrey Norton is a lawyer,
that is important.

344
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,753
Ominous, perhaps.

345
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:49,550
Why his repeated visits?

346
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:55,389
Is she his client,
friend, or mistress?

347
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,182
If he is her lawyer,

348
00:25:57,266 --> 00:26:02,271
he might have the photograph
to his strong box.

349
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:08,110
If her lover, he might
not even know of it.

350
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,788
She had just begun
to sing,

351
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:04,208
she has the voice
of an angel, Watson,

352
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,211
when a truly surprising
chain of events overtook me,

353
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:08,295
starting with the arrival

354
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,635
of someone I presumed to be
Mr. Godfrey Noble.

355
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,803
Wait for me, will you.

356
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:26,522
Fetch your
mistress's carriage.

357
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,488
Drive like the devil,

358
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:17,865
Church of St. Monica,
Edgeware Road.

359
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,200
I must arrive there at least
five minutes before 12:00.

360
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:24,538
That gives you 20 minutes.
Half a guinea if you do it.

361
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:03,410
She is a lovely woman, Watson,

362
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:07,164
with a face that
a man might die for.

363
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,251
A face a man might die for--

364
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:14,087
unusual language
for you, Holmes.

365
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:15,797
A metaphor,
Watson, nothing else.

366
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:18,800
I was just about to sprint after
the landau and perch on the back

367
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,928
when another cab
came through the street.

368
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:23,555
He looked twice
at such a shabby fare,

369
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,266
but I jumped in before
he had time to object,

370
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:27,684
showed him a handful
of sovereigns

371
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:28,393
and promised him one

372
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:31,021
if he would get me to the Church
of St. Monica within 20 minutes.

373
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,857
Now, I don't think

374
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:39,571
that I have ever been driven
faster in a cab.

375
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:44,701
They were there before us.

376
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:03,637
Look, I'm very sorry,
Mr. Norton, but l--

377
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,681
For pity sake,
it's almost midday.

378
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,683
The latest time
allowed by law.

379
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,685
I would have called in one
of those confounded churchmen

380
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,770
but I saw no reason to let them
know our business

381
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,230
and I sent them
off for a drink.

382
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:14,815
Oh, dear Lord!

383
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,442
Godfrey.

384
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:24,992
You, you,
come here, man!

385
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,663
Yes, I mean you!

386
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,665
We've only a few minutes left
or it won't be legal!

387
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:34,918
Come man, come!

388
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:46,180
Hold this and
do as you're told.

389
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:49,266
You'll be paid.

390
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:54,771
Ah, we have our witness.

391
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:58,692
The ceremony may proceed.

392
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:04,698
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here in the sight of God

393
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:08,368
to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony

394
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:11,330
which is an honorable estate
instituted of God

395
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,332
in the time of
man's innocency,

396
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:15,751
signifying unto us
the mystical union

397
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:18,253
that is betwixt Christ
and his church.

398
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:27,387
Irena.

399
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:30,140
I allowed you
to persuade me,

400
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:34,394
now you must allow me
to persuade you.

401
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,813
I shall see you tomorrow.

402
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:40,400
At the very first moment.

403
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:43,946
I love you.

404
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:05,551
John.

405
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,264
Hey, you!

406
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,770
Come here, my man.

407
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:21,441
Come here.

408
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:26,446
Godfrey, let me.

409
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:42,212
Sir, I want to thank you

410
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:46,383
for being so miraculously
present when we needed you.

411
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,803
How fortunate that you have
remained close by.

412
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:54,141
Well, I'm in no hurry, mum.

413
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,394
I hope you will accept this.

414
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:03,066
I don't need no tip, mum.

415
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:10,782
Oh, sir, let us call it
a little souvenir.

416
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:28,300
She gave me a sovereign.

417
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:29,218
Here it is.

418
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:34,264
What an extraordinary
turn of events!

419
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,225
I shall wear it
on my watch chain

420
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,145
in memory
of the occasion.

421
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:43,065
And what now?

422
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,982
Well, during the ceremony

423
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:46,151
I thought my plans
had been overthrown.

424
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,861
If they had made
an immediate departure,

425
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:48,737
it would have necessitated

426
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,615
the most prompt and
energetic measures on my part.

427
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,745
But, he went back to the Temple,
and she went to her own home,

428
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,582
thus, giving us
time to act.

429
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,876
How?

430
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,421
Doctor, I shall require all
your courage and alertness.

431
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,550
I shall be delighted!

432
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:12,010
You don't mind
breaking the law?

433
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:13,595
Not in the least.

434
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,767
Nor running the chance
of arrest?

435
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:22,563
Not in a good cause.

436
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:24,481
Oh, the cause is excellent.

437
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,108
Well, then I am your man.

438
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,734
Splendid.

439
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:07,900
Now, the--
the question is--

440
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:12,488
Holmes, you really do
look quite remarkable!

441
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,825
You know, the question is
where to find the photograph.

442
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,869
I mean, the house
has twice been burgled.

443
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:20,913
She was too clever for them.

444
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:23,248
She is a remarkable woman.

445
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,250
Well, they must
have searched very thoroughly.

446
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:27,669
They did not know
how to look!

447
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,172
And how will you look?

448
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:32,883
I shall not look.

449
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:34,843
What then?

450
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:37,179
I will allow her
to show me.

451
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:41,642
But she'll refused.

452
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,809
She will not be able to.

453
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:46,396
Ah, we draw near
the scene of action.

454
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:48,315
We had better
walk from here.

455
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,336
You know your instructions.

456
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,713
When you raise your hand,
I act.

457
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,299
And we meet at the rendezvous
in 10 minutes.

458
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:16,969
Here she comes.

459
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:30,941
Oh, no, you don't.

460
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,484
I was here first.

461
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:33,694
I opened the door, lady.

462
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:35,445
He never,
no, it was me!

463
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:38,031
Clear off, you two!

464
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,163
Let-me-go!

465
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:45,414
Opening carriage doors

466
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:48,292
is a legitimate means of
livelihood, Mr. [inaudible].

467
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:51,712
You ain't gonna stop
a man earning a copper, see.

468
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:52,713
Let me pass.

469
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,840
You there,
let go of my coachman!

470
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,925
Take the bread
from me mouth, would 'ya?

471
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,344
I'll fill your mouth, chum.

472
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:00,596
Oh!

473
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,237
Oh, no, no, please,
please don't, men,

474
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:19,990
please, I beg you,
please I beg of you!

475
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:23,911
Madam, I must protect you!

476
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:27,956
Now stop that,
you and you, stop that.

477
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,625
Oh!

478
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:31,585
Stand back!

479
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,796
You see what you've done!

480
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:37,966
He's dead!

481
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:41,929
Scamper, mate,
before the coppers come!

482
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,598
He's still breathing,
but he's taken a bad knock.

483
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:45,766
I am sorry, ma'am.

484
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:47,100
You did your best, John.

485
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:48,727
Is he badly hurt?

486
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,272
It is only superficial,
but he needs attention, quickly.

487
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,816
But he can't lie
on the street.

488
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:57,945
Bring him into the house.

489
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,785
All right, sir.

490
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,496
Oh, you're conscious.

491
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:53,834
Thank goodness,
you are a brave man.

492
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,587
Over here, Willot.

493
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,675
No, no, stand back,

494
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:04,344
I shall look after
my friend in need.

495
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:08,432
Sir, will you
look toward me.

496
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:11,977
Oh, it is no sight
for a lady.

497
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,980
I have strong nerves,
dear friend.

498
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,857
No, no, I cannot permit.

499
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:19,318
Thank you.

500
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:22,321
A bandage.

501
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:26,200
As you wish.

502
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:54,311
I'm so relieved that
your wound isn't serious.

503
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:59,816
Well, it is but shallow,
and the concussion wears off.

504
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:12,579
How extraordinary.

505
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:14,581
Madam?

506
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,624
That so many people

507
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:20,003
should gather in such
a quiet little turning.

508
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,505
Well, it's the gang, madam,

509
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,092
it was all pre-arranged
to rob you.

510
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:28,220
All those men
to snatch one little purse.

511
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:31,265
Oh, no, dear friend,
it wouldn't have paid them.

512
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:34,017
My vocation takes me
much amongst the poor

513
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:35,727
and even
the criminal classes, madam.

514
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:38,605
Look at those people staring,

515
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:44,736
curiosity is so unseemly,
but I fear universal.

516
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:49,783
Oh, I am so sorry,
I think I'm going to faint.

517
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,327
Oh, air, I need some air!

518
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,538
Willot, the window1

519
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,169
Oh!

520
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:10,053
Some drinking water.

521
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:15,559
Are there any smelling salts?

522
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:34,453
Madam, madam,
I think I can smell fire.

523
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:37,289
What?

524
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:40,292
Fire, fire!

525
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,753
Fire, fire, fire!

526
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:46,673
There's a fire, is there?

527
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:52,971
Madam, come out
of here quickly!

528
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,057
I'll take care
of the old gentleman!

529
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,187
I can't breathe.

530
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:03,941
It's a false alarm!

531
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:07,694
It's a false alarm, look!

532
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:10,739
It's a trick, it's a--
tell them--tell them!

533
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:13,408
There's a fire!

534
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:18,747
It's a false alarm,
do you hear?

535
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:22,167
We do not need
the fire engine!

536
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:32,928
What is it?

537
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:34,513
It is a plumber's rocket, madam,

538
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:38,058
one of my flock
is a plumber.

539
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:39,476
It is ignited by a cap,

540
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:43,730
and sends smoke into pipes
to betray cracks and holes.

541
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:45,023
No, no, no, no, no,
it's all right.

542
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:47,651
It will disperse.

543
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,946
You said it was a trick.

544
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,240
Who would play
such a trick on me?

545
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:54,992
One of the gang, madam.

546
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:57,911
But to what purpose?
I've escaped them.

547
00:42:58,036 --> 00:43:00,038
Revenge.

548
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:06,086
Revenge?

549
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,422
Are there such
wicked people?

550
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,591
There are people
in this world, madam,

551
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:16,138
to whom revenge is
in itself a reward.

552
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:21,643
I cannot
imagine such feelings.

553
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:24,938
I'm sure you cannot, madam.

554
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:28,609
Well, I am
feeling more myself.

555
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:32,196
I must be on my way.

556
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:35,282
Oh, please stay,
some refreshment.

557
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:37,784
Well, one of my flock
expects me.

558
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:40,162
Won't you let
my carriage take you?

559
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:43,582
Oh, no, no, no,
the air will aid my recovery.

560
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:49,087
At least your name,
your address,

561
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:51,423
that I may thank you
adequately.

562
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:55,260
Well, I am just
a humble servant, madam,

563
00:43:55,344 --> 00:44:00,057
of the all seeing
providence.

564
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:01,058
Goodnight.

565
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:09,191
Goodnight.

566
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:29,127
You did it
very nicely, Doctor.

567
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:30,295
You have the photograph?

568
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:32,381
No, but I know where it is.

569
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:34,007
How did you find out?

570
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:36,260
She showed me,
as I told you she would.

571
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,387
The trouble is, it still remains
in her possession.

572
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:40,848
You may have lost
your one chance, Holmes.

573
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:42,266
No.

574
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:44,852
I shall call
early tomorrow morning.

575
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,019
You'll call there?

576
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:48,730
And as my own self,
and with the King.

577
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:49,314
The King?!

578
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,650
And with you, Watson!

579
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:54,736
You must be a witness
at the end of our quest.

580
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:24,474
I trust you will sleep well
tonight for a change, Holmes.

581
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,395
Well, there's nothing like
success for curing insomnia.

582
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:32,566
Goodnight,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

583
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:34,902
and Watson.

584
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:35,944
Holmes?

585
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,918
But she could not love him.

586
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,419
I am in hopes
that she does.

587
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:53,128
Why?

588
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:54,338
Because it would
spare your Majesty

589
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:56,256
all fear of future annoyance.

590
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,760
If she loves her husband, then
she does not love your Majesty.

591
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,178
And if she does not
love your Majesty,

592
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:05,307
why should she interfere
with your Majesty's marriage.

593
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,733
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
I believe.

594
00:46:14,817 --> 00:46:16,401
I am Mr. Holmes.

595
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:19,530
My mistress told me
you were likely to call.

596
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:22,825
She left this morning with
her husband by the 5:15 train

597
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,410
from Charing Cross
for the Continent.

598
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:27,120
She has left England?

599
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:29,623
Never to return, sir.

600
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,583
All is lost.

601
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:50,561
Well then, get at it.

602
00:46:58,026 --> 00:46:59,778
This is not it!

603
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:06,869
Holmes, this is
a different photograph!

604
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:17,296
Do you hear me, man?!

605
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:20,507
The letter.

606
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:24,720
It is addressed to me.

607
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:31,101
"My Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:
You did it very well.

608
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:32,186
You took me in completely.

609
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:35,606
Until after the alarm of fire,
I had not a suspicion.

610
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:38,150
But then, when I found
that I had betrayed myself,

611
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:39,276
it flashed into my mind

612
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,196
that I had been warned
against you months ago.

613
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:44,740
I had been told that if
the King employed an agent

614
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:46,074
it would certainly be you.

615
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,493
Yet, with all this,

616
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:50,621
you made me reveal
what you wanted to know.

617
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:53,081
Even before when the presence
of so many people in the street

618
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:56,043
had sounded an alarm
in my instinct,

619
00:47:56,168 --> 00:48:01,590
I could not think evil of such
a dear, kind old clergyman.

620
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:05,427
But, you know,

621
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:08,430
I have been trained
as an actress myself,

622
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:11,808
and male costume
is nothing new to me.

623
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:16,230
Yes, it was I who followed you
to your door,

624
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:16,855
just to make sure

625
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:21,693
that you really were the
celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

626
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:26,532
It was I who rather imprudently,
wished you goodnight.

627
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:30,035
Then I started for the Temple
to see my new husband.

628
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:31,328
We had married in secret

629
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:35,249
in case we needed to leave
the country to elude the King.

630
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:39,294
Your appearance on the scene
was the signal for flight.

631
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:44,633
You are too formidable
an antagonist.

632
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:52,641
You will find the nest empty
when you call tomorrow.

633
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:58,939
As to the photograph,
your client may rest in peace.

634
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:06,238
I love and am loved
by a better man than he."

635
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:13,620
"The King may"--

636
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,754
"The King may do
what he will

637
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:27,509
without hindrance from one
whom he has cruelly wronged.

638
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:30,304
I kept it only
to safeguard myself,

639
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:33,974
and to preserve a weapon
which will always secure me

640
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:38,478
from any steps
he may take."

641
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:57,623
There is more.

642
00:49:57,706 --> 00:50:02,836
"I leave another photograph
which he might care to possess;

643
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,796
and I remain,
dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

644
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:11,845
very truly yours,
Irena Norton, nee Adler."

645
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:17,851
What a woman!

646
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:22,773
What a queen
she would have made!

647
00:50:22,898 --> 00:50:27,444
Is it not a pity
she was not on my level.

648
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:31,198
From what I have seen
of the lady,

649
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:34,868
yes, indeed, she is on a very
different level to your Majesty.

650
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:39,581
I am only so sorry that I have
failed in my commission.

651
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:41,416
On the contrary,
my dear sir,

652
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:44,169
nothing could be
more successful.

653
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:46,839
I know that her word
is inviolate.

654
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:50,551
The photograph is now as safe
as if it were in the fire.

655
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:53,095
I am glad that
your Majesty thinks so.

656
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,429
I am immensely
indebted to you.

657
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:58,684
Pray, tell me in
what way I can reward you.

658
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:02,354
This ring?

659
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:09,528
Your Majesty has something

660
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:12,156
which I should value
even more highly.

661
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:17,202
You have but to name it.

662
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:19,580
This.

663
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:21,623
Irena's photograph?

664
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:24,793
Certainly,
if you wish it.

665
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:25,627
Then I have the honor

666
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:29,673
to wish your Majesty
a very good morning.

667
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,767
And that was
how a great scandal

668
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:43,520
threatened the Kingdom
of Bohemia,

669
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:46,940
and how the best plans
of Mr. Sherlock Holmes

670
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:50,861
were beaten
by a woman's wit.

671
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:53,447
He used to sneer much
at the cleverness of women,

672
00:51:53,572 --> 00:51:56,074
but I have not heard him
do it of late.

673
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:58,994
And when he speaks
of Irena Adler,

674
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,537
or when he refers
to that woman,

675
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:06,710
it is always under the honorable
title of "the woman."

676
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:10,839
In his eyes, she eclipses
the whole of her sex.

677
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:13,550
It was not that he ever
betrayed any sign of love

678
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:15,135
for Irena Adler,

679
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,179
all emotions
such as that one

680
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:21,266
are abhorrent to
his cold, precise mind.

681
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,770
He only looks on women
pathologically,

682
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:27,981
as the source
of motives, clues.

683
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:35,739
And yet, he keeps her
photograph apart, locked up.

684
00:52:35,864 --> 00:52:39,535
There is but
one woman to him,

685
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:48,794
the beautiful Irena Adler, of
dubious and questionable memory.
