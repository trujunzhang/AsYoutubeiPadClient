39
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,069
question from mob in stone

40
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:47,208
governor as you're well aware

41
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,569
question war and peace has emerged as a
central issue in this campaign and the

42
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:52,318
give-and-take

43
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,049
recent weeks president carter's been
criticized for responding late too

44
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,050
aggressive soviet impulses

45
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,610
for insufficient build up a firm forces
and a paralysis in dealing with

46
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,310
Afghanistan Iran

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,500
you have been criticized for being all
too quick to advocate the use have lots

48
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,180
of muscle

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,480
military action to deal with foreign
crises

50
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,689
specifically what are the differences
between the two love you

51
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:25,689
on the uses american military power I
don't know what the differences might be

52
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,768
because I don't know what mister
carter's policies are

53
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,719
I do know what he said about mine and
I'm only here to tell you that I believe

54
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,620
with all my heart

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,580
that our first priority must be

56
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,659
world peace and that use-of-force

57
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:46,048
is always and only a last resort

58
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,110
when everything else is failed and then

59
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,480
only with regard to our national
security

60
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,959
now I believe

61
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,219
also that this meeting this mission this
responsibility for preserving the peace

62
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,919
which I believe is a responsibility
peculiar to our country

63
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,559
that we cannot shirk our responsibility
as the leader of the free world because

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,000
we're the only one that can do it

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,209
therefore the burden of maintaining the
peace falls on us

66
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,439
and to maintain that peace requires

67
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:27,219
strength America has never gotten a war
because we were too strong

68
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,960
we can get into a war by leading events
get out of hand as they have in the last

69
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,939
three and a half years

70
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,668
under the foreign policies of this
administration mister carter's

71
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:41,079
until we're faced each time with the
crisis

72
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:47,069
and a good management in preserving the
peace requires that we control

73
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,168
the events and tried to intercept be
four

74
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:54,839
they become a crisis but

75
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,089
I have seen four wars in my lifetime

76
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,579
I'm a father and sons I have a grandson

77
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:05,620
I don't ever want to see another
generation of young Americans

78
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,660
lead their lives into sandy beaches in
the pacific or

79
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,100
rice paddies in jungles in the in Asia
or the money but I've

80
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,060
body feels a battlefields of Europe

81
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,470
mister stone do you have a follow-up
question to the governor yes

82
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,930
governor we've been hearing that too the
defense hooker

83
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,709
buildup that you would associate
yourself with would cost tens of

84
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,728
billions of dollars more than is now

85
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:35,029
contemplated in assuming that the
american people are ready to

86
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:40,159
bear the scars they never will last keep
asking the following questions:

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,050
how do you reconcile huge increases in
military outlays with your promise some

88
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,310
substantial tax cuts

89
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,949
and a balancing the budget which in this
fiscal year

90
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:56,780
when the just-ended ran more than sixty
billion dollars in the red

91
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,019
mister stone I have submitted an
economic plan

92
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,818
and I worked out in concert with the
number I've fine economist in this

93
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:04,439
country

94
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,459
all Obama prove it and believe that over
a five-year projection

95
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,888
this plan can permit the extra spending
for

96
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,668
needed refurbishing a bar defensive
posture

97
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:21,568
that it can provide for a balanced
budget by 1983 if not earlier

98
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,139
and that we can afford along with the
cuts that I a proposed in government

99
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,310
spending

100
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,339
we can afford the tax cuts i proposed

101
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:35,250
and probably mainly because mister
carter's economic policy has built into

102
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,689
the next five years

103
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,079
and on beyond that a tax increase that
would be taking

104
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,939
$86 billion dollars more next year out
other people's pockets

105
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:48,579
and was taken this year and my tax cut
does not come close

106
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,250
to eliminating that eighty six billion
dollar increase I'm only reducing the

107
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,069
amount of the increase

108
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:57,389
in other words what I'm talking about is
not putting government back to getting

109
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,500
less money than governments in getting

110
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,348
but simply cutting the increase the in
in spending

111
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:07,490
no the same question now goes to
President Carter president I would you

112
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,819
like to have the question repeated

113
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:13,930
yes so president carter the question War
and Peace a central issue in this

114
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,168
campaign

115
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,098
you been criticized for in the
give-and-take for responding

116
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:22,829
late too aggressive soviet to impulses
for

117
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:27,818
insufficient build up a worm forces and
a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan

118
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,110
and Iran

119
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,189
governor reagan on the other hand has
been criticized for being all too

120
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,449
quick to advocate the use a plot to
muscle military action

121
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,610
to deal with them foreign crises such as
i've mentioned specifically

122
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,788
what are the differences between the two
%uh view on the uses american military

123
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:48,300
power

124
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,360
bitch down out had to make thousands of
decisions

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,860
since I've been president serving in the
oval office

126
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,080
and each one of those decisions that
affect the future my country I have

127
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,889
learned in the process

128
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,009
I think I'm a much wiser more
experienced man and i watch

129
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,960
when I debated for years ago against
president ford

130
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,909
about sewer line that they are no simple
answers to complicated questions

131
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,080
a Jamaican said that for every problem
there's a simple answer

132
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,279
it would be need

133
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,918
and possible and wrong the fact is that
this nation

134
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,418
in eight years before I became president
had its own military

135
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,750
strength decrease

136
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,158
seven out of eight years the budget
commitments for defense went down

137
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,389
thirty-seven percent in all center but
in others we've got a steady

138
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:46,250
carefully planned methodical but very
effective increase

139
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,000
in our commitment for defense but what
we've done

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,059
mystic you that in almost power and

141
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:57,149
and prestige and military strength love
it United States

142
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,028
to preserve the peace but not only kept
peace for our own country

143
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:04,549
but we've been able to extend the
benefits apiece to others

144
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:08,059
in the Middle East we work for peace
treaty between Israel and Egypt

145
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:09,379
successfully

146
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:12,990
and have tied ourselves together with
Israel and Egypt

147
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,070
in a common defense capability this

148
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,260
is a very good step forward for our
nation's security

149
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,700
and will continue to do as we've done in
the past

150
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,759
I might also and that they are decisions
that are made in the Oval Office

151
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,309
by every president which upper found in
nature

152
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:35,018
there are always problems but in the
world and how those

153
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:38,060
troubled areas are addressed by
president

154
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:43,149
alone who in that oval office affects
our nation directly

155
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,190
the involvement of the United States and
also our american interest

156
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,890
that is a basic decision has to be made
so frequently

157
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:54,659
by every president who serves that's
what I try to do successfully by keeping

158
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,019
our country at peace

159
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:00,220
this is Tanya a follow up on us I i
would like be a little more specific on

160
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
the use military power and

161
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,940
let's talk about one area for a moment
under what circumstances would to use

162
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,610
military force is

163
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,889
to deal with for example a shot of a
Persian oiled Gulf

164
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:15,958
if that should occur are to counter a
russian expansion beyond Afghanistan

165
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,458
into

166
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,500
either Iran or Pakistan I asked this
question and your

167
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,980
charges they we are woefully unprepared
to project sustained and i emphasize the

168
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,278
word sustained

169
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,309
power in that part of the world just
down in my state of the union

170
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:34,379
address earlier this year a point out
that

171
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:39,000
any threat to the stability of security
in the persian gulf

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,159
would be a threat to the security of our
own country

173
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,088
in the past we've not had an adequate
military presence in that region

174
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,390
now we have two major carry a task
force's

175
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:53,220
we have access to facilities in five
different areas of that region

176
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,920
and wave made it clear working with our
allies and others

177
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,769
that we are prepared to address any
foreseeable eventuality

178
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,679
which by in a rut commerce with a
crucial area the world

179
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,799
but in doing this we have made sure that
we address this question

180
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,719
peacefully not injecting American
military forces in the combat

181
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,990
but letting a straight about nation be
felt in a beneficial way

182
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,149
this I believe has should that I ages
will be protected in the

183
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:24,169
Persian Gulf region as we've done in the
Middle East

184
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:28,629
and throughout the world governor reagan
you have a minute to comment or rebut

185
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:32,320
but yes I question the figure about the
decline in

186
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,879
a defense spending under the two
previous administrations and

187
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,370
appreciating eight years to this
administration

188
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,019
I would call your attention that too we
were in a warrant that wound down during

189
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,720
those eight years which of course made a
change in

190
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,790
military spending because I've returning
from war to peace

191
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:51,250
I also would like to point out the
republican presidents in those years

192
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,950
faced with the Democratic majority in
both houses of the congress

193
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,579
found that their request for defense
budgets were very often cut

194
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,028
now Gerald Ford left

195
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:07,578
a 5-year projected plan for a military
build-up to restore our defenses in

196
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:09,679
president carter's administration

197
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,219
reduced at by 38 percent cut sixty ships
out within a building program that have

198
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,110
been proposed

199
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,450
and stop the

200
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,980
the B-one delayed the cruise missile
stop the production line for the

201
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,190
Minuteman missile stop it right answer
delay the tridents

202
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,100
submarine and now is planning a mobile

203
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,519
military force that can be delivered to
various spots in the world

204
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,360
which does make me question his assaults
on whether I am the one that ish

205
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,829
quick to look for use a force president
carter you have the last word on this

206
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,689
question

207
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,320
whatever's elements up when someone is
to control nuclear weapons which I hope

208
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,200
will get to you later on because that's
a modest

209
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,740
important single issue in this campaign

210
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,839
another one is how to address trouble
areas in the world I think habitually

211
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,399
governor reagan is advocated the
injection a military forces into trouble

212
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,528
areas

213
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:06,860
when I and my predecessors both
Democrats and Republicans

214
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,950
have advocated resolving those troubled
and those difficult difficult areas in

215
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,778
the world

216
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:15,828
peacefully diplomatically and through
negotiation

217
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,009
in addition to that the buildup of
military forces

218
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:22,439
is good for our country because we've
got to have military strength in order

219
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,730
to preserve the peace

220
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,629
but I'll always remember that the best
weapons

221
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,519
other one to the other part in combat
and the best soldier is one who never

222
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,560
has to laid his life down

223
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,599
on the field of battle spring

224
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,070
is imperative for p but the two must go
hand in hand

225
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,720
thank you gentleman the next question is
from Harry Ellis to president carter

226
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,490
mister president when you are elected in
1976

227
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,759
the consumer price index stood at 4.8
percent

228
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,819
it now stands at more than 12 percent
perhaps more significantly the nation's

229
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,670
broader

230
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:03,479
underlying inflation rate has gone up
from seven to nine percent

231
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,930
now a part of that was due to external
factors beyond US control notably

232
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:12,469
the more than doubling about oil prices
by OPEC last year

233
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,060
because the United States remains

234
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:20,528
vulnerable to such external shocks can
inflation in fact

235
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:24,799
be controlled if so what measures would
you pursue

236
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,588
in a second term

237
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:33,199
again it's important to put Leone
situation into perspective

238
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,859
in 1974 we had a so-called oil shock

239
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,129
where an the price of opec always raised
it to an extraordinary degree

240
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:45,448
we had an even worse all shock in 1979

241
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:49,549
in 1974 we had the worst recession

242
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:53,599
the deepest and most penetrating
recession since the Second World War

243
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,089
the recession that resulted this time
was a British we've had since the second

244
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,519
world war

245
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,860
in addition we brought down inflation

246
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,909
earlier this year the first quarter we
did have a very severe

247
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:10,259
inflation pressure brought about by the
opec price increase do everything about

248
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,039
18 percent the first quarter this year
the second quarter

249
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,349
we had dropped it down to about 13
percent the most recent figures the last

250
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,310
three months to the third quarter this
year

251
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:24,219
inflation rate is seven percent still to
mine

252
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,160
but it illustrates very vividly that in
addition to providing

253
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,860
anonymous number of jobs nine million
new jobs in the last three and a half

254
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,639
years

255
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,620
that inflationary threat is still urgent
ownership

256
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,980
I noticed the governor reagan reason I
mention that reagan camp roth proposal

257
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,539
which is already made george bush this
crime as Buddha economics

258
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,028
and said it would result in a 30 percent
inflation right

259
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:52,850
and BusinessWeek which is not a
democratic publication said

260
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,019
that this reagan can run proposal and I
quote them I think

261
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,459
was completely irresponsible and would
result

262
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,609
inflationary pressures which would
destroy this nation

263
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,850
so %ah proposals are very sound and very
carefully considered

264
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,459
to stimulate jobs to improve them

265
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:14,989
the industrial complex in this country
to create tools for american workers

266
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,769
then at the same time would be
anti-inflationary and nature

267
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,828
so dad nine million new jobs to control
inflation and to plan for the future was

268
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:23,198
a

269
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,419
energy policy now and tagged as a
foundation

270
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,509
is our plan for the years ahead mister
others do you have a follow-up question

271
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,240
for mister carter

272
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,209
yes mister president you have mentioned
the creation of 9 million new jobs

273
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:41,739
at the same time the unemployment rate
still hangs high

274
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,669
as does the inflation rate now I wonder

275
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:49,860
can you tell us what additional policies
you would pursue

276
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,310
in a second administration in order to
try to bring down

277
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:58,179
that inflation rate and would it be an
active leadership

278
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:02,379
to tell the american people they're
going to have to sacrifice

279
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:06,088
to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some
time to come

280
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:09,909
yes we have demanded that the American
people sacrifice and they've done very

281
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,538
well

282
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:15,109
as a matter of fact we are importing
today

283
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,088
about one-third less all from overseas
than we did just a year ago

284
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:22,688
we've had a 25 percent reduction to
firstly I was in office

285
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,600
at the same time as I said earlier we
have added about nine million net new

286
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,750
jobs in that period of time

287
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,298
a record number will for cheap also the
new energy policy has been predicated on

288
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:34,660
two factors one

289
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,140
conservation which require sacrificed
and the other one increase in production

290
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,030
American energy which is going along
very well more call the sheer

291
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,298
than ever before in history mall and gas
wells drilled this year

292
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,418
than ever before in history the new
economic

293
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:52,509
revitalization program we have in mind

294
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:56,669
which will be implemented next year
would result in tax credits

295
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:00,520
which would let businesses invest in new
to a new fact is to create even more new

296
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,940
jobs about a million

297
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,390
in the next two years and we also have
planned a youth

298
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,429
employment program which would encompass
600,000 jobs for young people

299
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:13,960
this is already passed the House now has
a national prospect passed Senate

300
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,769
now the same question goes to governor
reagan governor reagan would you like to

301
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,548
have the question repeated

302
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:24,900
governor again during the past four
years the consumer price index

303
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,370
has risen from 4.8 percent to currently

304
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:33,229
over twelve percent and perhaps more
significantly the nation's broader

305
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,579
underlying rate of inflation is gone up
from seven to nine percent

306
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:42,629
now a partner that has been due to
external factors beyond US control

307
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,260
and notably the more than doubling up a
pack of oil prices last year

308
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,970
which leads me to ask you whether since
the United States

309
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,288
remains vulnerable to such external
shocks

310
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:58,669
can inflation in fact be controlled

311
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,700
if so specifically what measures would
you pursue

312
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,798
mister ellis I think this idea that has
been

313
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:09,779
respond here in our country that
inflation somehow came up on it's like a

314
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:13,440
plague and therefore it's uncontrollable
and no one can do anything about it

315
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,509
is entirely spurious and its dangerous
to say this to the people

316
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:22,410
I'm just gonna became president
inflation was 4.8 percent as you said it

317
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,950
had been cut into

318
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,600
by President Gerald Ford it is now
running a 20.7 percent

319
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,819
president carter also has spoken at the
new jobs created what we always with the

320
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:36,759
normal growth in our country an increase
in population

321
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,079
increase the number of jobs but that
can't hide the fact that there are eight

322
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,259
million

323
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:44,548
men and women out of work in america
today and two million to those lost

324
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:47,720
their jobs in just the last few months

325
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,630
to Goddard also promised that he would
not use unemployment as a tool to fight

326
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,559
against inflation

327
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,990
and yet his 1980 economic message stated
that we would reduce productivity and

328
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,339
gross national product and increase
unemployment

329
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:04,369
in order to get a handle on inflation
because a in January at the beginning of

330
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,808
the year it was more than 18 percent

331
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:10,288
since then he has blamed to the people
for inflation opec

332
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:15,109
he blamed the Federal Reserve System he
has blamed the lack of productivity the

333
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:16,459
American people

334
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,970
he is then accused the people who live
in too well and

335
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,600
that we must share in scarcity we must
sacrifice and get used to doing with

336
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,038
less

337
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:27,408
we don't have inflation because the
people living too well we have inflation

338
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:28,730
because the government

339
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,390
is living too well and the last
statement

340
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,740
just a few days ago was a speech to the
effect that

341
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,659
we have inflation because government
revenues have not kept pace with

342
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:41,020
government spending

343
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,808
I see my time is running out here I have
to get this down very fast

344
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:48,168
yes you can lick inflation by increasing
productivity

345
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,340
and by decreasing the cost the
government to the place that we have

346
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:52,558
balanced budgets

347
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,700
and i no longer running grinding are
printing press money

348
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,798
flooding the market with it because the
government is spending more than it

349
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,690
takes in and my economic plan calls for
that

350
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,600
the president's economic plan calls for
increasing

351
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,829
but taxes to the point that we finally
takes so much money away from the people

352
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:14,470
but we can balance the budget in that
way but we'll have a very poor nation

353
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,190
and a very unsound economy if we follow
that path a follow-up

354
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:23,200
mister allen's yes you have centered on
cutting government spending in what you

355
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,288
have just said about

356
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:29,000
your own policies you have also said
that you would it increased defense

357
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,509
spending

358
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:35,339
specifically where would you cut
government spending

359
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:38,918
if you were to increase defense spending
and

360
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,038
also cut taxes so that presumably

361
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,400
federal revenues would shrink well

362
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,100
most people when they think about
cutting government spending they think

363
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,750
in terms of eliminating

364
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,980
necessary programs or wiping out
something some service the government is

365
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,500
supposed to perform

366
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,179
I believe that there is another
extravagance in fact in government

367
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,890
as a matter a fact term one of the
secretaries have a GW under mister

368
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,909
carter testified that he thought there
was seven billion dollars worth of fraud

369
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:13,700
the and waste in welfare and in the
medical programs associated with it

370
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,940
we've had the general accounting office
estimated

371
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,880
there is probably tens of billions of
dollars that is lost in fraud alone and

372
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,630
they have added that

373
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,970
waist adds even more to that we have a
program for a gradual reduction of

374
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,339
government spending

375
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,918
based on these theories and I have a
task force now that I've been working on

376
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,559
where those cuts could be made I'm
confident that it can be done

377
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,879
and that it will reduce inflation
because I did

378
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,750
in California and inflation went down
below the national average in California

379
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,940
when we return money to the people and
reduced government spending

380
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,100
president carter Ham

381
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,199
governor reagan's proposal the red ink
Mr of proposal

382
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,029
is one of the most highly inflationary
ideas that have a has been presented to

383
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,609
the american public

384
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:05,788
he would actually have to cut government
spending

385
00:23:05,788 --> 00:23:09,798
Palace 230 billion dollars in order to
balance a budget under this ridiculous

386
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:11,329
proposal

387
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:15,889
I notice that this task force is working
for his future plans

388
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,259
had some other ideas revealed in the
wall street journal this week

389
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,019
one of those ideas was to repeal the
minimum wage

390
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:26,119
and several times this year governor
reagan has said

391
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:31,178
that the major cause unemployment is the
minimum wage

392
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:34,929
this is a heart this kind of approach to
the working families about country which

393
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:35,960
is typical

394
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,120
but many republican leaders in the past

395
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,038
but I think has been accentuated under
governor reagan in California

396
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,069
I'm surprised given reagan brought this
up

397
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:49,528
he had three largest tax increases

398
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,009
in history that state under his
administration

399
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:57,460
he more than doubled state spending
while he was governor 120 percent

400
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,440
increase

401
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,880
and have between 20 and 30 percent
increase in the number of employees

402
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,250
Sara din and California route thank you
sir it's a governor reagan has the last

403
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,548
word on this budget

404
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:12,400
yes the figures that the president is
just used about California

405
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,120
and is a distortion of the situation
there

406
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,528
because while I was governor of
California

407
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:23,079
are spending in California increased
less per capita

408
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:26,639
than the spending in Georgia almost
Carter was governor

409
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,630
Georgia in the same four years the size
of government

410
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,880
increased only 16 in California

411
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,028
I've wanted increased in proportion to
population in Georgia

412
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:42,720
and the idea that my tax cut proposal is
inflationary I would like to ask the

413
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,419
president

414
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:47,679
why is it inflationary to let the people
keep more of their money and spend it

415
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,019
the way they'd like

416
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:52,379
and it isn't inflationary to let him
take that money and spend it the way he

417
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,039
wants

418
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,908
I wish that question need not be
rhetorical but it must be because we run

419
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,370
out of time on that

420
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:01,729
Maltby the third third question

421
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,429
to governor reagan from William Hill you

422
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:09,669
yes governor reagan the decline in
garcetti's has been hastened by the

423
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:11,710
continual rise in crime

424
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,900
strain race relations befallen the
quality of public education

425
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,380
the persistent a bad number poverty in a
rich nation

426
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,000
may decline in the services to the
public the signs seem to point what I D

427
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Terry Asian

428
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,480
that could lead to the establishment at
the promenade underclass

429
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,429
in the city's what specifically would
you do in the next four years

430
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:37,970
to reverse this trend I have been
talking to a number of congressman

431
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,980
who have much the same idea that I hear
and that is that in the inner city areas

432
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,558
that in cooperation with local
government

433
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:52,220
and with national government and using
tax incentives and Whincup cooperation

434
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,819
with the private sector

435
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:57,700
but we have development zones what the
local

436
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,090
entity the city declare this particular
area based on the standards have

437
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:06,168
the percentage of people on welfare
unemployed and so forth in that area

438
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:09,259
and then through tax incentives induced

439
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:14,929
the creation a business is providing
jobs and so forth in those areas

440
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:19,440
the elements have government through
these tax incentives for example a

441
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,880
business that would not have for a
period of time

442
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,730
an increase in the property tax
reflecting its development of the unused

443
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,650
property

444
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,490
that it was making wouldn't be any loss
to the city

445
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,210
because she isn't getting any tax from
that now and would simply be a delay

446
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,690
and on the other hand many of the people
that would then be given jobs are

447
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,650
presently words have the government

448
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,769
and wouldn't hurt to give them a tax
incentive because im

449
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,480
they that wouldn't be costing government
anything either

450
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,390
I think there are things to do in this
regard I stood in the south bronx

451
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,230
on the exact spot the president aristede
on in 1977

452
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,429
you have to see it to believe it it
looks like a bombed-out city

453
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:04,230
great gone skeletons a building's
windows smashed out

454
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,950
painted on one of them unkept promises
on another despair

455
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,269
and miss with this bad which President
Carter had promised

456
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:16,950
that he was going to bring in bass
program to rebuild this department

457
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,899
their home or this area their whole
blocks of land that are left bare

458
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:25,369
I'll just bulldoze down flat

459
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:29,369
and nothing has been done and they are
now charging to take tourists through

460
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:30,408
there to see

461
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:35,070
this terrible desolation I talk to a man
just briefly there who asked me one

462
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:36,528
simple question

463
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:41,159
do I have reason to hope that I can
someday take care of my family again

464
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,789
nothing has been done follow-up mister
him

465
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:49,849
yes governor reagan blacks and other
non-whites are increasing in numbers in

466
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:51,148
our cities

467
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:54,569
many of them feel that they are facing a
hostility from right

468
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:58,808
that prevents them from joining the
economic mainstream a bar society

469
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:02,288
there's racial confrontation in the
schools on jobs

470
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:07,038
and housing is non-white seek to reap
the benefit to the free society

471
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:13,359
what do you think is the nation's future
as a multi-racial society

472
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,479
I believe in it I am eternally
optimistic and I happen to believe that

473
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,569
we've made great progress from

474
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:22,408
the days when I was young and when this
country didn't even know what had a

475
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,880
racial problem

476
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,179
I know those things can grow out of
despair in an inner-city

477
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:31,350
and when there's hopelessness that at
home

478
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:35,349
lack of work and so forth but I believe
that all of us together and I believe

479
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:39,209
the presidency is what teddy roosevelt
said it was it a bully pulpit

480
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,159
and I think that something can be done
from there because the goal for all of

481
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:44,730
us should be

482
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,849
that one day things will be done neither
because I'm

483
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:52,788
nor in spite of any of the differences
between us

484
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:57,359
ethnic differences are racial distrust
differences whatever they may be

485
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,089
but we will have total equal opportunity

486
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:04,548
for all people and I would do everything
I could in my power

487
00:29:04,548 --> 00:29:08,408
to bring that about mister Hilliard
would you repeat your question for

488
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:10,700
president carter im

489
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,759
president carter the decline have our
cities has been hastened by the

490
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,750
continual rise in crime

491
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,880
strain race relations befallen the
quality of public education

492
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,899
the persistence of have normal poverty
in a rich nation

493
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:27,879
and a decline in services to the public
the signs seem to point to a

494
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,080
deterioration

495
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:32,668
that could lead to the establishment of
the permit underclass in the city's

496
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:37,870
what specifically would you do in the
next four years to reverse this trend

497
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:42,079
equity but I was campaigning in 1976

498
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,599
very well when the mayors and local
officials were in despair

499
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:51,219
about the rapidly deteriorating central
cities have a nation

500
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,360
we initiated a very fine urban renewal
program

501
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,990
working with the mayor's the governors
and other interested officials

502
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,839
this is Ben a very successful effort
that's one of the main reasons that

503
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,129
we've had such an increase in the number
of people employed

504
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,820
other nine million people put to work a
new job since I've been in office

505
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:13,639
1.3 million of those has been among
black Americans

506
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,110
another million among those who speak
Spanish

507
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:20,509
we now planning to to continue

508
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:23,778
the revitalization program with
increased

509
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:27,179
commitments of rapid transit mass
transit

510
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,259
under the windfall profits tax we expect
to spend about forty

511
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:33,390
three billion dollars and the next 10
years

512
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,700
to rebuild a transportation system to
backcountry we also are pursuing

513
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,308
housing programs we've had a 73 percent
increase

514
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:45,019
and allotment of federal funds for
improved education

515
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:48,898
these are the kinds of efforts worked on
a joint bases with community leaders

516
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:52,538
particular in a minority areas other
central cities that had been

517
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:55,379
deteriorating so rapidly in the past

518
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,340
it's very important to us that this be
done with a full involvement

519
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:04,048
minority citizens I brought into the
top-level top-level to government

520
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:08,778
into the white house into administrative
offices about the executive branch

521
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:12,528
inode into the judicial system highly
qualified

522
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:17,169
black and Spanish citizens and women who
in the past had been excluded

523
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:20,970
I notice a governor reagan said it when
he was a a young man

524
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,019
that there was no knowledge of a racial
problem in this country

525
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,620
those who suffered from discrimination
because a brace

526
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,449
or sect certain in New we had a racial
problem

527
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,669
we have gone a long way to a correcting
these problems

528
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:40,669
but we still have a long way to go
follow-up question

529
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:44,399
best present I don't like to see repeat
the same follow up to you

530
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,528
blacks in other non-white to increasing
in numbers in our cities

531
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:51,538
minute didn't feel that they are facing
hostility from whites that prevents them

532
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:54,710
from joining the economic mainstream a
bar society

533
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,278
there's racial computation the school's
on jobs and housing is non-white seek to

534
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:02,130
reap the benefit to the free society

535
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:08,028
what is your assessment at the nation's
as a featured in a multi-racial society

536
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:12,250
ours is a nation are full refugees

537
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,788
a nation of immigrants almost all our
citizens came here from

538
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:20,359
other lands and now have hopes

539
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:23,439
which are being realized forgot a life

540
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,450
preserving their ethnic commitments

541
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,000
their family structures their religious
beliefs

542
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,659
preserving their relationships with
their relatives in foreign countries

543
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,019
but still following themselves together
in a very coherent society

544
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:40,769
which gives our nation in strength in
the past

545
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:44,798
those minority groups have often been
excluded from participation in the

546
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,398
affairs of government

547
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,398
since i've been president have appointed
president

548
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:52,869
more than twice as many black federal
judges

549
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:56,428
as all previous presidents in history
this country

550
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:00,460
I done the same thing and Department of
women and also

551
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,929
spanish-speaking Americans to involve
them in administration of government

552
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,798
and a feeling that they belong to the
societal structure that makes decisions

553
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,918
in the judiciary and executive branch is
a very

554
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,370
important commitment which I am trying
to realize I will continue to do so

555
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:20,819
in the future governor reagan you have a
minute rebuttal yes

556
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:24,308
the president talks Obama programs and

557
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:27,990
they have their place but as governor
when I was at that

558
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,929
into the line and receiving some of
these grants for government programs I

559
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:32,870
saw that so many of them were dead and

560
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:36,778
they were public employment for these
people who really want to get out into

561
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:37,200
the

562
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,470
private job market where there are jobs
with the future

563
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,740
and the president spoke a moment ago
about but I was against the minimum wage

564
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,769
I wish she could have been with me when
i sat with a group of

565
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:53,019
teenagers who were black and who were
telling me about their unemployment

566
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,620
problems

567
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:59,408
and that it was the minimum wage that
had done away with the jobs that they

568
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:00,600
once could get

569
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,538
and indeed every time it is increased
you will find that there is an increase

570
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:05,419
in minority

571
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:10,289
unemployment among young people and
therefore I have been in favor

572
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:13,789
%uh a separate minimum for them

573
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:16,619
with regard to the great progress that
has been made with this government

574
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:17,858
spending

575
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:22,699
the raid a black unemployment in Detroit
Michigan is fifty six percent

576
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:26,598
president carter you have the last word
on this question

577
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:29,639
well it's obvious that we still have a
long way to go and fully incorporating

578
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,210
the minority groups into the mainstream
of American life

579
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,869
we have made good progress and is no
doubt in my mind that the commitment to

580
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,220
unemployment compensation a minimum wage

581
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:43,858
welfare national health insurance those
kind of commitment

582
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:46,898
that have to provide the Democratic
Party since

583
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:50,509
ancient history in this country's
political life are very important

584
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,109
element of the future

585
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:56,889
in all those elements governor reagan
has repeatedly spoken out against them

586
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,900
which to me showed a very great
insensitivity to giving

587
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,250
deprived families a better chance in
life

588
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,349
this to me is a very important
difference between him

589
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:11,539
and me in this election and i believe
the american people will judge

590
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:12,989
accordingly

591
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:16,929
there's no doubt in my mind that in the
downtown central cities

592
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:20,779
with the with the new commitment on an
energy policy

593
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,470
with a chance to revitalize home to make
them more

594
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:28,719
fuel-efficient where the chance for
synthetic synthetic fuels program

595
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,529
solar power this will give us an
additional I'll tunity for jobs which

596
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,670
will pay rich dividends back you
gentleman

597
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:39,539
now for the fourth question to president
carter from barbara walters

598
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:43,880
the president the EISA the country
tonight on the hostages in Iran

599
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,740
I realize this is a sensitive area but
the question of how we respond to acts

600
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:48,729
of terrorism

601
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:53,199
goes beyond this current crisis other
countries have policies that determine

602
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,819
how they will respond

603
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,500
Israel for example considers hostages
like soldiers and will not negotiate

604
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,179
with terrorists

605
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:03,019
for the future mister president the
country has the right to know do you

606
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:05,809
have a policy for dealing with terrorism

607
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:09,699
wherever it might happen and what did we
learn from this experience

608
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:12,759
in around that might cause us to do
things differently

609
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,440
if this was something similar happens
again

610
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,550
brother wanted the blige on this

611
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:27,260
world is a threat and the activities of
terrorists

612
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,040
one other reason economic summit
conferences between myself

613
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,529
and the other leaders are the Western
world we committed ourselves to take

614
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,030
strong action against terrorism

615
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:41,019
airplane hijacking was one elements %uh
that commitment

616
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:44,199
there's no doubt that we have

617
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:47,230
seen in recent years in recent months

618
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,750
additional tax a balanced against Jews
and

619
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:55,429
France and of course against those who
live in Israel by the PO and other

620
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:58,618
terrorist organizations

621
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,809
ultimately the most serious terrorist
threat

622
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:07,289
is if one of those radical nation to
believe in terrorism in a policy

623
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:10,420
should have atomic weapons

624
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,820
both I and all my predecessors had a
deep commitment to controlling the

625
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,150
proliferation

626
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,599
have nuclear weapons in countries like
Libya all iraq

627
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,480
we have even alienated some about poses
trade partners because we have insisted

628
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,079
upon the control

629
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,630
up the spread of nuclear weapons to
those potentially terrorist countries

630
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,890
when governor reagan has been asked
about then he makes a very disturbing

631
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:35,150
comment

632
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,570
that nonproliferation other control the
spread of nuclear weapons

633
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:44,420
is not about business and when he was
asked specifically racially about iraq

634
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,150
he said there's nothing we can do about
it this ultimate

635
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,070
terrorist threat is the most fearsome a
ball

636
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,890
and as part of a pattern where our
country must stand firm

637
00:37:56,889 --> 00:38:00,429
to control terrorism of all kinds

638
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:03,899
miss waters a follow-up yes

639
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,829
while we are discussing policy head
around not taken American hostages I

640
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,619
assume that in order to preserve our
neutrality

641
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:15,780
we would have stopped the flowers spare
parts and vital raw materials want war

642
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,920
broke out between

643
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,108
Iraq and Iran now offering to lift the
ban on such goods if there are people

644
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:22,619
come home

645
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:26,640
doesn't this me more I'm terrorism
compromise our neutrality

646
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,670
and possibly antagonized nations now
family to rise in the Middle East

647
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,700
we will maintain no position and
neutrality

648
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:40,219
in the iran and the right wall we have
no plans to sell

649
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:43,519
additional material all goods to Iran

650
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,710
that might be able like nature when I'm

651
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,990
made my decision to stop all trade with
Iran

652
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:54,179
as a result other taking about hostages

653
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:57,679
I announced they're not have
consistently maintained since then

654
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,769
that if the hostages are released safely
that we would make delivery on those

655
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:02,519
items

656
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:05,849
which Iran owns which I have bought and
paid for

657
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:09,769
also that the frozen Iranian assets

658
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:12,769
would be released that's been a
consistent policy

659
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:17,599
19 10 Dec area but you repeat the
question now for governor again please

660
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,730
meet want me

661
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,608
yes governor the either the country
tonight remain on the hostages in Iran

662
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:26,779
with the question of how we respond to
acts of terrorism goes beyond this

663
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,730
current crisis

664
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,869
there are other countries that have
policies that determine how they will

665
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:31,838
respond

666
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,049
Israel for example considers hostages
like soldiers and will not negotiate

667
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,599
with terrorists

668
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,630
for the future country has the right to
know do you have a policy

669
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,660
dealing with terrorism wherever it might
happen

670
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:47,328
and what we learned from this experience
in Iraq and that might cause us to do

671
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:49,859
things differently if this was something
similar

672
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:54,460
should happen again bar you there's that
question twice I think you want to have

673
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,300
at least one answer to it

674
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,250
I am I have been accused of

675
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,269
lately I'm having a secret plan with
regard to the hostages

676
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,588
now this comes from an answer that I had
made at least 50 times during this

677
00:40:08,588 --> 00:40:10,449
campaign to the press

678
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:14,568
which is the the question would be: have
you any ideas of what you would do if

679
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:15,880
you were there

680
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,950
and I said well yes and I think that
anyone seeking this position

681
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:23,929
as well as other people probably have
thought to themselves

682
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:27,559
what about this what about that these
are just ideas

683
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:31,568
what I would think I've if I were in
that position and had access to the

684
00:40:31,568 --> 00:40:35,389
information in which I would know all
the options that were open to me

685
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:39,230
I have never answered the question
however second

686
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,699
the one the same as well tell me what
are some %uh those ideas first of all I

687
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:46,269
would be fearful that I might say
something that was

688
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:49,940
presently underway are in negotiations
and does expose it and

689
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:55,220
endanger the hostages and sometimes I
think some of my ideas might involve

690
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:59,189
quiet diplomacy where you don't say in
advance or say to anyone

691
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,869
what it is you're thinking doing your
question is difficult to answer

692
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:07,950
because in the situation right now

693
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:11,139
no one wants to say anything that would
inadvertently

694
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:14,529
delay in any way the return of those
hostages at their

695
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:19,950
if there is a chance for the coming home
soon or that might cause them harm

696
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:23,129
but I do think should be done once they
are safely here

697
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,900
with their families in that tragedy is
over and we've been doing this

698
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,240
humiliation for just lacking one week of
the year now

699
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,618
then I think it is time for us to have a
complete investigation

700
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,849
as to the diplomatic efforts that were
made in the beginning

701
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:43,170
why a they have been there so long and

702
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:48,059
when they come home what did we have to
do in order to bring that about

703
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:51,210
what arrangements were made and I would
suggest that congress

704
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,429
should hold such an investigation in the
meantime I'm going to continue praying

705
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,629
that they'll come home

706
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,858
follow-up question I would like to say
that neither candidate answer

707
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:01,539
specifically the question no

708
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:05,250
I have a specific policy for dealing
with terrorism but I will ask governor

709
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,199
reagan &

710
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:10,169
different following question: you've had
suggested that there would be no Iranian

711
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,409
prices had you been president

712
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:15,578
because we would have given family
support to the shock

713
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:18,920
but Iran is a country of 237 million
people who are resisting a government

714
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,829
today regarded as dictatorial

715
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:24,190
my question is not whether the show was
busy regime was preferable to the

716
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,289
ayatollahs

717
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:28,279
but whether the United States has the
power or the right to try to determine

718
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,050
what form a government any country will
have

719
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:36,039
and do we back unpopular regimes whose
major merit isn't that they are friendly

720
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:39,318
to the United States

721
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:43,159
the degree oven popularity over regime

722
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,059
when the choice is total
authoritarianism

723
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:50,449
I totalitarianism I should say

724
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:54,379
in the alternative government makes one
wonder whether you

725
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,410
are being helpful to the people and
we've been guilty of that

726
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:01,279
because someone didn't meet exactly our
standards have human rights even though

727
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,940
they were an ally a barge

728
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,858
instead of trying patiently to persuade
them to change their ways

729
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:10,190
we have in a number of instances

730
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:15,150
aidid a revolutionary overthrow which
results in complete totalitarianism

731
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:20,280
instead for those people and I think
that this is a Condo hypocritical policy

732
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,380
when the same time we're maintaining a
detente with the one nation in the world

733
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,200
where there are no human rights at all

734
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:29,848
the Soviet Union now there was a second
phase

735
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:33,309
in the around in a fair in which we had
something to do with that

736
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:36,389
and that was we had adequate warning

737
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:39,118
that there was a threat to our embassy
and we could have done what other

738
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,720
embassies do neither strengthen our
security there

739
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,739
or remove our personnel before

740
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:48,689
the kidnapping the takeover took place
the other I'm sorry I missed interrupt

741
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:53,039
president carter you have a minute for
rebuttal

742
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,818
I didn't hear any come in from governor
reagan about what he would do to stop

743
00:43:56,818 --> 00:43:59,630
for the reduced terrorism in the future

744
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,519
but the western allies did decide to do
is to stop all air flights commercial

745
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,420
airplanes to any nation and bald

746
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,769
in terrorism hijacking a plane to the
harboring up hijackers

747
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:14,719
secondly we all committed ourselves as I
love my predecessors in the oval office

748
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,989
not to permit the spread of nuclear
weapons

749
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:22,779
to a terrorist nation or to any other
nation that does not presently have

750
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,910
those weapons or capabilities for
explosives

751
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:29,328
third not to make any sale to material
weapons

752
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:32,970
to an Asian which is involved in
terrorist activities

753
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:35,980
and last but not to deal with a pillow

754
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,880
until and unless the P lol recognizes
Israel's right to exist

755
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,210
and recognizes UN resolution 242 as a
basis for Middle East peace

756
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:49,139
these are a few other things to which
our nation is committed

757
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:52,578
and we will continue with these
commitments been governor reagan you

758
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:54,400
have the last word on that question

759
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,550
yes I have no quarrel whatsoever with
the things that have been done because I

760
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,579
believe it is high time

761
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:02,510
that the civilized countries in the
world made it plain that there is no

762
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,020
room worldwide

763
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:07,219
for terrorism there will be no
negotiation with

764
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:10,559
terrorist have any kind and while I have

765
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,429
a last word here I would like to correct
a misstatement of fact by the

766
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:15,489
president's

767
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:19,239
I I have never made the statement that
he suggested about

768
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:23,699
nuclear proliferation and nuclear
proliferation or the trying to

769
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:29,309
hold it would be an major part of the
foreign policy of mine

770
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,670
thank you gentleman bad as the first
half for the debate now the rules for

771
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,769
the second half

772
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:37,568
quite simple there only complicated when
I explain them

773
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:43,039
the him second half the panel is with me
will have no followup questions

774
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,130
instead after the panelists have asked a
question

775
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,170
the candidates have answered each of the
candidates will have two opportunities

776
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,500
to follow up

777
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:55,050
to question to rebut are just a comment
on his opponent statement

778
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,730
governor reagan will respond in this
section to the first question for mob in

779
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:59,829
stone

780
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:04,130
governor reagan arms control president
said it was the single most important

781
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,130
issue

782
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,460
both love you will have expressed the
desire than the nuclear arms way

783
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:13,510
race with russia but by methods that are
vastly different

784
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:18,290
you suggest that we scrap the salt two
treaty already negotiated

785
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:21,920
and intensify the build-up American
power

786
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,220
in to induce the soviets to sign a new
treaty

787
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:30,469
one more favorable to us yes president
carter on the other hand

788
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:34,779
says he will again trying to convince a
reluctant Congress

789
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:40,220
to ratify the present treaty and the
ground it's the best we can hope to get

790
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:46,129
both you cannot be right will you tell
us why you think you are

791
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,640
yes I think I'm right because I believe
that we must have a consistent foreign

792
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,049
policy a strong america and a strong
economy

793
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,990
and then as we build up on national
security

794
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:02,358
to restore our margin of safety we have
the same time try to restrain

795
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:05,869
the soviet build-up which has been going
forward

796
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:10,950
a rapid pace and for quite some time

797
00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:16,949
the shot two treaty was the result of
negotiations

798
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:21,739
mister carter's team entered into after
he had asked

799
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:26,199
the Soviet Union for a discussion on
actual reduction

800
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:29,379
have nuclear strategic weapons and his
emissary

801
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,660
I think a moment twelve hours with
having heard

802
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:36,710
a very definite net but taking that one
no

803
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:42,500
from the Soviet Union we then went back
into negotiations on their terms because

804
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,050
mister carter had canceled the B-one
bomber

805
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:49,230
delay the MX delay the Trident submarine
delayed the cruise missile shut down the

806
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:49,980
missile man

807
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,858
but three the Minuteman a missile
production line

808
00:47:53,858 --> 00:47:57,529
and whatever other things that that
might have been done the Soviet Union

809
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,800
sat at the table knowing that we had
gone for with unilateral

810
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:08,089
considerate up concessions without any
reciprocation from them whatsoever

811
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:13,068
now I have not blocked the salt two
treaty as

812
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:17,599
card and mister mondale suggest that I
have it has been blocked by a Senate in

813
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,960
which there is a democratic majority

814
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,818
indeed the Senate Armed Services
Committee voted 10 to 0 with seven

815
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,210
abstentions

816
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:28,909
against the salt two treaty and declared
that it was not

817
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:32,889
in these national security interest on
the United States

818
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:37,588
besides which it is illegal because the
law of the land passed by Congress says

819
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:38,808
we cannot

820
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:42,790
except the treaty in which we are not
equal

821
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:46,259
and we're not equal in this treaty for
one reason alone

822
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,640
are B-fifty two bombers are considered
to be strategic weapons

823
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:54,318
their backfire bombers are not the
governor at dinner up to that point

824
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:57,679
time's up for that but the same question
now to president carter

825
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,649
yes sir president carter both the viewer
expressed the desire them the nuclear

826
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,380
arms wave

827
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,579
race with russia but through vastly
different methods

828
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:09,619
the governor suggest we scrap the salt
two treaty

829
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:15,030
which you negotiated Indiana I R sign to
me and intensify the build-up American

830
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,250
power to induce the soviets to sign a
new treaty

831
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:22,280
10 more favorable to us you on the other
hand

832
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,030
say you will again try to convince a
reluctant Congress to ratify the present

833
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,869
treaty

834
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:32,579
on the grounds it is the best we can
hope to get from the russians

835
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:37,539
you cannot both be right will you tell
us why you think a

836
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:41,719
you are yes I'll be granted

837
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:45,939
the inflation unemployment thus it is

838
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,519
all very important issues but they pale
into insignificance

839
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:54,509
in their life and it is a president when
compared with the control of nuclear

840
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,010
weapons

841
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:59,829
every president who has served in the
Oval Office Center truman

842
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:04,849
has been dedicated to the proposition of
controlling nuclear weapons

843
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:08,490
to negotiate with the Soviet Union
balanced

844
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:11,729
controlled observable and then

845
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:16,269
reducing levels atomic weaponry

846
00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:20,880
there is a disturbing pattern an
attitude governor reagan

847
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,780
he has never supported any of those arms
control agreements

848
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,980
the limited test ban salt 1

849
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,469
know that the the anti-ballistic missile
treaty

850
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:37,608
not a bottom-up stock traded negotiated
with the Soviet Union by

851
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:42,380
president ford and now he wants to throw
into the wastebasket

852
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,269
a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a
balanced an equal basis

853
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:50,088
between ourselves and the soviet union
negotiated over a seven-year period

854
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,799
by myself and my to republican
predecessors

855
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,230
the senate has not voted yet on the
strategic arms limitation treaty

856
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,838
there have been preliminary skirmishing
in the committed to the senate

857
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,929
but the treaty has never come to the
floor of the senate for you to a debate

858
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:12,509
or a bowl it's understandable that a
senator

859
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:17,240
in the preliminary debate can make an
irresponsible statement

860
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:21,949
a maybe an ill-advised statement you've
got 99 other senators to correct

861
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:25,429
that mistake if it is a mistake but one

862
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:30,299
a man who hopes to be president says
take this treaty

863
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,859
discarded do not vote do not debate

864
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:38,239
do not explore the issues do not

865
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,989
finally capitalize on this long
negotiation

866
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:45,949
that is a very dangerous and disturbing
thing governor reagan you have an

867
00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:47,750
opportunity to rebut that

868
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:51,679
yes I'd like to respond very much first
of all

869
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,909
the Soviet Union if I have been critical
of some other previous agreements is

870
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:56,818
because we've been

871
00:51:56,818 --> 00:52:01,300
out negotiated for all quite a long time
and they have managed in spite of all

872
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,369
OVR

873
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:07,079
attempts and arms limitation took to go
forward with the biggest military

874
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:09,420
buildup in the history of man

875
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,599
now to suggest that because two
republican presidents tried to

876
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:17,190
pass the salt Rudy treaty that puts them
on its side I would like to say

877
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:21,260
but president ford who is within ninety
percent

878
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,119
up in a tree a treaty that we could be
in agreement with when he left office

879
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,390
is emphatically against this salt treaty

880
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:33,348
I would like to point out also that
senators like an rejection and

881
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:38,079
hollinger South Carolina they are taking
the lead in the fight

882
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,920
against this particular treaty I am NOT
talking to scrapping

883
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,519
I am talking up taking the treaty back

884
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,599
and going back into negotiations and I
would say to the soviet union we will

885
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,140
sit and negotiate with you as long as it
takes

886
00:52:54,139 --> 00:52:57,259
to have not only legitimate arms
limitation

887
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,030
but to have a reduction of these nuclear
weapons to the point that neither one of

888
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,010
us represents a threat to the other

889
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,140
that is hardly throwing away a treaty

890
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:09,440
and being opposed to arms limitation

891
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,650
present current yes

892
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:17,720
a regular rate is making some very
misleading and disturbing statements

893
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:21,578
he not only advocates the scrapping of
this treaty and I don't know that these

894
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:22,619
men and he quotes

895
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:27,568
are against a tree in his final poll but
he also advocates a possibility

896
00:53:27,568 --> 00:53:31,219
he said it's been a missing element
applying a trump card

897
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:34,808
against the Soviet Union other nuclear
arms race

898
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:37,890
and insisting upon nuclear superiority

899
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:41,900
by our own nation as a predication for
negotiation in the future with the

900
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,480
Soviet Union

901
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,469
if president brezhnev said we will scrap
this treaty

902
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:50,289
negotiated under three american
presidents over seven year period of

903
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:51,369
time

904
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:56,700
we insist upon nuclear superiority as a
basis for future negotiations

905
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:00,259
and we believe that the launching up a
nuclear arms race

906
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:04,040
is a good basis for future negotiations

907
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:08,130
it's obvious that I as president an
all-american would reject such a

908
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:09,410
proposition

909
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:13,039
this would mean the resumption a very
dangerous

910
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:17,210
nuclear arms race it would be a very
disturbing to American people

911
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,789
it would change the basic tone and
commitment that our nation has

912
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,808
experienced

913
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:24,920
ever since the second world war with all
presidents democratic and republican

914
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,369
and would also be very disturbing to
allies all of whom

915
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:32,780
support this nuclear arms treaty in
addition to that

916
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:36,119
the adversarial relationship between
ourselves and the Soviet Union

917
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,568
what on down to deteriorate very rapidly
this attitude

918
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:42,880
is extremely dangers in the lead role in
this tome

919
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,750
although it said with the choirboys
governor reagan

920
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,298
know the president's supposed to be
replying to me but sometimes I have a

921
00:54:50,298 --> 00:54:52,759
hard to have been connecting what he's
saying

922
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,280
with what I have said what my position
Zack

923
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,500
sometimes think like the witch doctor
the gets mad when a good doctor comes

924
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,519
along with a cute little work

925
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,079
me my

926
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:10,309
point I have made already ex-president
with regard to

927
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:14,940
negotiating it does not call for nuclear
superiority in the party the United

928
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,230
States

929
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,690
it is calls for a mutual reduction on
these weapons

930
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:23,179
as I say to the point that neither of us
can represent a threat

931
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:27,230
to the other and to suggest that the
salt two treaty that your negotiators

932
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:28,280
negotiated

933
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,640
was just a continuation and based on all
of the

934
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:36,298
appreciating average by two previous
presidents is just not true

935
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:39,719
it was a new negotiation because as i
say president ford

936
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,250
was within about 10 percent having a
solution that could be acceptable and I

937
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,460
think our allies

938
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,699
would be very happy to go along with the
fair

939
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:52,389
and verifiable shot agreement

940
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:55,879
president carter you have the last word
on this question

941
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,650
I think to close at this discussion it
would be better to put into perspective

942
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:04,338
but we're talking about I had a
discussion with my daughter Amy

943
00:56:04,338 --> 00:56:07,460
the other day before I came here to ask
what the most important issue what she

944
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,539
said she thought nuclear weaponry

945
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:13,670
the and the control of nuclear arms

946
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:18,130
this his upper middle portion

947
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,818
some of these weapons have 10 megatons
explosion

948
00:56:21,818 --> 00:56:25,108
if you put fifty times AT&T in each

949
00:56:25,108 --> 00:56:29,750
10 railroad cars you would have a
carlotta TNT

950
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:33,630
a train or TNT stretching across this
nation that's one

951
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:37,858
major war explosion

952
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:40,929
in a warhead we have

953
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:43,989
thousand equivalent

954
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:47,669
up megaton all million tons of TNT
warhead

955
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,150
the control of these weapons is the

956
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:54,150
single major responsibility for
president

957
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:59,900
and the cash down this commitment of all
presidents

958
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,730
because of some slight technicalities
that can be corrected

959
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,809
is a very dangerous to approach we have
to go to another question now

960
00:57:07,809 --> 00:57:11,059
from Harry Ellis to president carter

961
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:15,349
mister president as you have said
Americans through conservation are

962
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:19,910
importing much less oil today than we
were even a year ago

963
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:23,108
yet US dependence on Arab oil

964
00:57:23,108 --> 00:57:28,130
as a percentage of total imports is
today much higher than it was

965
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:31,700
at the time of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo

966
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:35,858
and for some time to come the law so
substantial amounts in Arab oil

967
00:57:35,858 --> 00:57:39,348
could plunge the US into depression

968
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:42,970
now this means that a bridge must be
built out at this dependence

969
00:57:42,969 --> 00:57:46,058
can the united states develop

970
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:49,920
synthetic fuels and other alternative
energy sources

971
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,068
without damage to the environment and
will this process mean steadily higher

972
00:57:55,068 --> 00:57:58,750
fuel bills for american families

973
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,858
I don't think is in town then the future

974
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:05,039
the cost of oil is going to go up

975
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,250
what I've had as a basic commitment to
tab and as president

976
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:14,030
is to reduce our dependence on foreign
oil they can only be done in two ways

977
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:17,619
want to conserve energy to stop the
wasted energy

978
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:21,640
and secondly to produce more American
energy we've been very successful in

979
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:23,308
both cases

980
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:27,440
we've now reduced importing a foreign
all in the last year old

981
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,588
by one-third we imported today

982
00:58:30,588 --> 00:58:34,699
2 million barrels a ball less damn good
at the same day

983
00:58:34,699 --> 00:58:38,649
just a year ago this commitment has been

984
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:42,798
opening up a very bright investor for a
nation in the future

985
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:46,358
because with the when Paul profits tax
as a base

986
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:49,818
we now have an opportunity to use
american technology

987
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,980
an American ability in america natural
resources

988
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,608
to expand rapidly the production of
synthetic fuels yes

989
00:58:56,608 --> 00:58:59,900
to expand rapidly the production of
solar energy yes

990
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,220
and also to produce a conventional kind
of American energy

991
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:06,739
we will grill all and gas wells this
year than any

992
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:09,969
year in history will produce more polish
eum

993
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:13,439
than any year in history we are
exporting more coal this year

994
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,900
than any year in history and we have an
opportunity now

995
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,900
with improved transportation systems
improve loading facilities in our port

996
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,730
to see a very good opportunity on it
world international market

997
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:27,798
to replace OPEC oil with American coal

998
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:31,940
as a basic images source: this exciting
future

999
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,780
were not only give us more energy
security will also open up vast

1000
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,640
opportunities for americans to live a
better life and I have millions of new

1001
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:42,328
jobs associated with

1002
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:45,619
this new and very dynamic industry now

1003
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:50,559
in prospect because %uh the new energy
policy we put into effect

1004
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,569
would you repeat the question now the
governor reagan

1005
00:59:53,568 --> 00:59:58,058
governor reagan Americans through
conservation are importing much less oil

1006
00:59:58,059 --> 00:59:59,269
today then

1007
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:03,139
we were even a year ago and yet US

1008
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:06,150
reliance on Arab oil as a

1009
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:11,108
percentage of total imports is much
higher today than it was during the 1973

1010
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,409
Arab Oil Embargo

1011
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:16,818
and the substantial loss of Arab oil

1012
01:00:16,818 --> 01:00:19,960
could plunge the united states and a
depression

1013
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,440
the question is whether the development
%uh alternative energy sources

1014
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,909
in order to reduce this dependence can
be done

1015
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:32,690
without damaging the environment and
will it mean for american families

1016
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:37,099
steadily higher fuel bills

1017
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:40,380
I'm not so sure the remains deadly
higher fuel cost

1018
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,220
but I do believe that this nation has
been portrayed for too long a time to

1019
01:00:45,219 --> 01:00:47,189
the people as being energy poor

1020
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:51,639
when it is energy-rich the call the
president mentioned yes we have it in

1021
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:53,139
yet 18 the bar

1022
01:00:53,139 --> 01:00:56,368
total coal resources is not being
utilized at all

1023
01:00:56,369 --> 01:01:00,548
right now the mines are closed down
there a twenty-two thousand miners out

1024
01:01:00,548 --> 01:01:01,509
of work

1025
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:06,329
most to this is due to regulations which
either interfere with the mining have a

1026
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:10,019
or prevent the burning up in with our
modern technology

1027
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:15,108
yes we can Bernard call within the
limits of the Clean Air Act

1028
01:01:15,108 --> 01:01:19,199
I think as technology improves will be
able to do even better with that

1029
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:23,279
the other thing years that we have only
least out

1030
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,990
begun to explore 2 percent of our outer
continental shelf

1031
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:32,159
for oil where it is believed by everyone
from any with that

1032
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,769
if you will and that source of energy
but there are vast supply ship to be

1033
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:36,809
found

1034
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:40,990
our government has in the last year's
show taken I would've

1035
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:44,919
multiple use millions have acreage

1036
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,930
of public lands that once were

1037
01:01:47,929 --> 01:01:51,199
while the Republic land subject to
multiple use exploration for minerals

1038
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:53,608
and so forth it is believed that
probably

1039
01:01:53,608 --> 01:01:57,219
seventy percent and the potential oil in
the United States

1040
01:01:57,219 --> 01:02:00,639
is probably hidden in those lands

1041
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:03,739
and no one is allowed to even go and
explore to find out if it is there this

1042
01:02:03,739 --> 01:02:05,949
is particularly true of the region

1043
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:10,108
average to shut down part of alaska

1044
01:02:10,108 --> 01:02:13,288
nuclear power there were 36 power plants

1045
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:17,740
planned in this country and let me add
the word safety it must be done with the

1046
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:19,209
utmost to safety

1047
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:24,039
but 32 of those had given up and cancel
their plans to build

1048
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:29,400
and again because government regulations
and permits and so forth take

1049
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,920
make it take more than twice as long to
build a nuclear plant in the United

1050
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,680
States as it does to build one in Japan
or in Western Europe

1051
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:39,989
we have the sources here we are
energy-rich

1052
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:43,529
and call is one of the great potentials
we had

1053
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:47,750
president Garry O'Connor mission

1054
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,030
therapy myself we have

1055
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:55,048
this year the opportunity

1056
01:02:55,048 --> 01:02:59,829
which will realize to produce $800
million tons of coal

1057
01:02:59,829 --> 01:03:04,260
and on equaled record in the history of
our country

1058
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:08,440
governor reagan says that this is not a
good achievement

1059
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,670
any blames restraints on coal production
on regulations

1060
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:17,588
regulations that affect the light and
the health and safety of miners

1061
01:03:17,588 --> 01:03:20,679
and also regulation to protect the
purity of our area

1062
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:25,500
and a quality about water and on land we
cannot cast aside those regulations

1063
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,659
we have a chance in the next 15 years
insisting upon the

1064
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:32,710
help and safety up workers

1065
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:36,530
in the mines and also preserving the
same high

1066
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:41,000
air and water pollution standards to
triple the amount of coal we produce

1067
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,010
governor reagan's approach to our energy
policy

1068
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:47,440
which is already proven its
effectiveness is to repeal of to change

1069
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,700
substantial the windfall profits tax

1070
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:53,960
to return a major portion of $227
billion dollars back to all companies

1071
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,000
to do away with the Department of Energy
to short-circuit

1072
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,420
are synthetic fuels program to put a
minimum

1073
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:06,159
%um emphasis on solar power to emphasize
strongly

1074
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:09,588
nuclear power plant as a major source of
energy in the future

1075
01:04:09,588 --> 01:04:13,538
you want to put all our eggs in one
basket and give that basket

1076
01:04:13,539 --> 01:04:17,470
to the major oil companies governor
reagan

1077
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:22,209
that is a misstatement of course have my
position I just happen to believe that

1078
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:26,659
free enterprise can do a better job
producing the things that people need

1079
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:31,368
then government can the Department of
Energy has a multi-billion dollar budget

1080
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:34,858
in excess of $10 billion dollars it has
introduced a portable Winter Olympic

1081
01:04:34,858 --> 01:04:37,940
collar anything else no wind energy

1082
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,579
and for the win mister carter to suggest

1083
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:44,890
the I want to do away with the safety
laws

1084
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:48,848
and with the laws that pertain to clean
water and clean air and so forth

1085
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:53,880
as governor of California I don't charge
a passing the strictest

1086
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,900
air pollution laws in the United States

1087
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:01,670
the strictest air quality law that has
ever been adopted in the United States

1088
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:04,838
and we created an ocean

1089
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:08,730
an occupational safety and health agency
for the protection of employees

1090
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:12,369
before the federal government had one in
place and to this day

1091
01:05:12,369 --> 01:05:16,619
not one of its decisions are rulings has
ever been challenged

1092
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:20,318
so I think some those charges are
missing the point

1093
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:23,969
I am suggesting that there are literally
thousands of

1094
01:05:23,969 --> 01:05:26,969
unnecessary regulations

1095
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:32,118
but invade every facet a business and
indeed very much about personal lives

1096
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:36,150
that are unnecessary the government can
do without that added a 130 billion

1097
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:39,039
dollars to the cost of production in
this country

1098
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,109
and that are contributing their part

1099
01:05:42,108 --> 01:05:45,279
add to inflation and I would like to say
yes

1100
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,940
a little more free as we once were
president carter another crack at that

1101
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:53,409
sure as a matter fact the air pollution

1102
01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:57,500
standard laws that were passed in
california passed over

1103
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,880
the objections of governor reagan and

1104
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,910
this is a very well known fact

1105
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:07,858
also racially when someone suggested
that the Occupational Safety and Health

1106
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:09,900
Act should be abolished

1107
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,769
governor reagan responded a man

1108
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:17,639
they offshore drilling rights

1109
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:21,449
is a question that governor reagan
raises often as a matter fact

1110
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:25,088
in the proposal for the alaska lands
legislation

1111
01:06:25,088 --> 01:06:28,130
a hundred percent of all the offshore

1112
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:32,309
land would be open for exploration
ninety-five percent of all the alaska

1113
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:34,410
lands were it is suspected

1114
01:06:34,409 --> 01:06:37,838
I believe that mineral members might
exist

1115
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,779
we have with our five year plan for the
leasing a lot sure land

1116
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:46,970
proposed moral land to be drilled

1117
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:51,980
than has been open up for drilling sense
this program for started in 1954

1118
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:55,588
so we're not putting restraint on
American exploration we're encouraging

1119
01:06:55,588 --> 01:06:56,969
it in every way we can.

1120
01:06:56,969 --> 01:07:01,108
governor reagan you have the last word
on this question yes

1121
01:07:01,108 --> 01:07:05,588
if it is a well-known fact that I
opposed air pollution laws in California

1122
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:09,969
the only thing I can possibly think I
visit the president must be suggesting

1123
01:07:09,969 --> 01:07:13,298
the law that the federal government
tried to impose on the state of

1124
01:07:13,298 --> 01:07:14,739
California nadolol

1125
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:19,689
regulations that would have made it
impossible to drive an automobile within

1126
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:23,039
the city limits have any California city

1127
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,190
or have a place to put it if you did
driver against their regulations

1128
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:31,068
it would have destroyed the economy of
california and I must say we had the

1129
01:07:31,068 --> 01:07:33,259
support of congress when we pointed out

1130
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:37,549
how ridiculous this attempt was by the
Environmental Protection Agency

1131
01:07:37,548 --> 01:07:42,079
we still have the strictest air
controller air pollution laws

1132
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:47,289
in the country as for offshore oil in
only 2 percent now

1133
01:07:47,289 --> 01:07:51,069
is so least and is producing oil

1134
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:56,190
at the the rest as to whether the open
their lands are going to be opened

1135
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:59,920
in the next five years or so we're
already five years behind

1136
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,780
in what we should be doing there is more
oil now in the wells that have been

1137
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,298
drilled

1138
01:08:05,298 --> 01:08:08,380
then has been taken out in a hundred and
twenty year one years that they've been

1139
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:08,940
drilled

1140
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,480
thank you governor thank you mister
president the next question

1141
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,140
goes to governor again from William hey
you did

1142
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:20,480
governor reagan wage earners in this
country especially the young

1143
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,428
are supporting a social security system
that continues to affect their income

1144
01:08:24,429 --> 01:08:25,880
drastically

1145
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,350
the system is fostering a struggle
between the young and the old

1146
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:33,179
in his dripping the country 20
polarization and these two groups

1147
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:36,298
how much longer can the young
wage-earner expect to bear the

1148
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:37,810
ever-increasing burden

1149
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:40,909
the social security system

1150
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,979
the social security system was based on
a false premise

1151
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:47,759
with regard to how fast the number of
workers would increase in how fast the

1152
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,810
number of retirees would increase

1153
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:53,449
it is actuarially out a balance and this
first became

1154
01:08:53,448 --> 01:08:58,349
evident about sixteen years ago and some
others were voicing mornings then

1155
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:02,370
now it is trillions have dollars how to
balance

1156
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:06,920
and the only answer that has come so far
is the biggest single tax increase in

1157
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,310
our nation's history

1158
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:12,370
the payroll tax increase for social
security

1159
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:16,509
which will only put a band-aid on this
and postpone the day of reckoning

1160
01:09:16,509 --> 01:09:20,149
by a few years at most what is needed

1161
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:23,229
is a study that I a proposed by a task
force

1162
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:27,028
to look to experts to look into this
entire problem as to how it can be

1163
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:30,069
reformed and made actuarially sound but

1164
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:35,449
with the premise that no one present be
depended on social security is going to

1165
01:09:35,448 --> 01:09:37,349
have the rug pulled out from under them

1166
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:41,489
and not get their check we cannot
frightened as we have with the threats

1167
01:09:41,488 --> 01:09:44,278
in the campaign rhetoric that is going
on in this campaign

1168
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:49,040
our senior citizens leave them thinking
that in some way they're endangered

1169
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:52,509
and they would have no place to turn
they must continue to get those checks

1170
01:09:52,509 --> 01:09:55,420
and I believe that the system can be put
on a sound

1171
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:59,270
actuarial basis it's going to take some
study and some work

1172
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:03,460
and not just passing a tax increase to
let the load

1173
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:08,779
or the roof fall in on the next
administration

1174
01:10:08,779 --> 01:10:12,109
that he would you repeat that question
for president carter

1175
01:10:12,109 --> 01:10:15,170
yes President Carter wage earners in
this country

1176
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:19,050
specially on are supporting a social
security system

1177
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:22,170
that continues to affect their income
drastically

1178
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:25,399
the system is fostering a struggle
between young and old

1179
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:29,039
in district in the country 20
polarization oh these two groups

1180
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:32,510
how much longer Kenny young wage-earner
expect to bear the ever-increasing

1181
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:33,710
burden

1182
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:37,439
the social security system

1183
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:41,119
as long as as a democratic president in
the white house we will have a strong

1184
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:42,359
and viable

1185
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:46,389
social security system free a threat a
bankruptcy

1186
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:49,900
although governor reagan is changes
position lightly on four different

1187
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:53,819
occasions he has advocated making social
security a voluntary system

1188
01:10:53,819 --> 01:10:57,000
which would in a back very quickly
bankrupted

1189
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,979
I noticed also in the Wall Street
Journal earlier this week that a

1190
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:02,928
preliminary report his passport
advocates

1191
01:11:02,929 --> 01:11:06,789
making social security's more sound
producing

1192
01:11:06,789 --> 01:11:10,420
the adjustments in social security for
the retired people

1193
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:13,810
to compensate for the impact have
inflation

1194
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:17,340
the scandal approach is a very dangerous
to the security

1195
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,850
and the well-being and the peace of mind
other retired people in this country

1196
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:26,030
and those approaching retirement age but
no matter what it takes in the future

1197
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:30,250
to keep Social Security sound it must be
kept that way

1198
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:33,550
and although there was a serious threat
to the social security system

1199
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:37,100
and its integrity during the 1976
campaign about

1200
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:41,320
and became president the action other
democratic congress working with me

1201
01:11:41,319 --> 01:11:44,500
has been to put social security back
home a sound

1202
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,969
financial basis that's the way it will
stay

1203
01:11:47,969 --> 01:11:52,149
governor reagan well there just isn't
true

1204
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:55,399
it is I said delayed the actuarial

1205
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:59,988
I'm in balance a falling on us for just
a few years with an increase in taxes

1206
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:02,169
and I don't believe we can go on

1207
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:05,859
increasing the tax because the problem
for the young people today is that

1208
01:12:05,859 --> 01:12:08,289
they're paying in far more than I can
ever expected

1209
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:13,789
to get out now again this statement that
somehow I wanted to destroy it and I

1210
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:14,988
just changed

1211
01:12:14,988 --> 01:12:20,899
my tune and I'm was for voluntary social
security which would mean the ruin of it

1212
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:26,229
mister president the voluntary thing
that I suggested many years ago

1213
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:29,229
why's that a young man orphaned

1214
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:32,859
and raised by an aunt who died

1215
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:36,920
his aunt was ineligible for social
security insurance

1216
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,090
because she was not his mother and I
suggested that this is an insurance

1217
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,260
program

1218
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,489
certainly the person who's paying in
should be able to name

1219
01:12:45,488 --> 01:12:49,139
his own beneficiaries and that's the
closest I've ever come

1220
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:52,520
do anything voluntary with social
security

1221
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:58,150
I to and pledged to a social security
program that will reassure the senior

1222
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:59,299
citizens of ours

1223
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,710
they're going to continue to get their
money there are some changes I'd like to

1224
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:03,630
make

1225
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:06,969
I would like to make a change that
discriminates in the regulations against

1226
01:13:06,969 --> 01:13:07,800
him

1227
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,829
and wife who works and finds that she
then

1228
01:13:11,829 --> 01:13:15,340
is faced with the choice between heard
from other husbands benefits if he dies

1229
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,000
first

1230
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,679
or what she is paid in but it does not
recognize that she has also been

1231
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:23,730
paying in herself and she is entitled to
more

1232
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:29,009
she presently can get I'd like to change
that president carter's rebuttal now

1233
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:32,070
I'm this constant

1234
01:13:32,069 --> 01:13:36,158
no suggestions that the basic social
security system should be

1235
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:40,339
change does called concern and
consternation among the

1236
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:45,810
aged about country it's obvious that we
should have a commitment to them

1237
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:49,429
that social security benefit should not
be taxed know that would be no

1238
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:52,090
peremptory change in the standard by
which

1239
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:55,719
Social Security payments are made to the
retired people

1240
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:59,158
we also need to continue to index the
social security payments

1241
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:03,439
so that if inflation rises the social
security payments would rise

1242
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,619
a commensurate degree the let the buying
power

1243
01:14:06,619 --> 01:14:11,300
other social security check continue
intact

1244
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:16,050
in the past the relationship between
social security and medicare

1245
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:19,140
has been very important to provide some
modicum

1246
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,679
other aid for senior citizens and the
retention

1247
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:27,359
up health benefits governor reagan as a
matter fact began his political career

1248
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:29,698
campaigning around this nation

1249
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:34,198
against medicare now we have an
opportunity to move toward national

1250
01:14:34,198 --> 01:14:35,629
health insurance

1251
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:39,289
with an emphasis on the prevention of
disease

1252
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:42,769
an emphasis on outpatient care not in
patient care

1253
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:47,409
an emphasis on hospital cost containment
to hold down the cost of hospital care

1254
01:14:47,408 --> 01:14:51,979
for those who are ill an emphasis on
catastrophic health insurance

1255
01:14:51,979 --> 01:14:55,089
to live a family is threatened with
being wiped out economically because a

1256
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,039
very well a very high

1257
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:00,210
medical bill then the insurance would
help pay for it

1258
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:03,239
these are the kind of element other
national health insurance important to

1259
01:15:03,238 --> 01:15:04,519
the american people

1260
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,520
governor reagan again typically is
against

1261
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,969
such a proposal governor

1262
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:15,859
there you go again when I oppose
medicare

1263
01:15:15,859 --> 01:15:20,039
there was another piece of legislation
meeting the same problem before the

1264
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:21,119
congress

1265
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,849
I happen to favor the other piece of
legislation and thought that it would be

1266
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:28,679
better for the senior citizens and
provide better care than the one

1267
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:32,619
but was finally passed I was not
opposing the principal providing care

1268
01:15:32,619 --> 01:15:33,250
for them

1269
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:36,488
I was opposing one piece of legislation
as

1270
01:15:36,488 --> 01:15:40,928
versus another there is something else
about social security course that

1271
01:15:40,929 --> 01:15:43,619
doesn't come out to the payroll tax it
comes out of the

1272
01:15:43,619 --> 01:15:47,079
general fund the something should be
done about

1273
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:51,210
I think it's disgraceful that the
disability insurance fund in social

1274
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:52,469
security

1275
01:15:52,469 --> 01:15:57,658
finds checks going every month to tens
of thousands of people who are locked up

1276
01:15:57,658 --> 01:16:00,369
in our institutions for crime

1277
01:16:00,369 --> 01:16:04,619
or from mental illness and they are
receiving disability checks

1278
01:16:04,619 --> 01:16:08,569
from social security every month pollen
state institution

1279
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:11,679
provides for all their needs and their
care

1280
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,149
president carter you have the last word
on this question

1281
01:16:15,149 --> 01:16:19,238
I think this debate on Social Security
medicare

1282
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:23,919
national health insurance typifies as
vividly as any other

1283
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,039
subject tonight the basic historical
differences between the Democratic Party

1284
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:33,819
and the Republican Party the allusions
to basic changes in the minimum wage is

1285
01:16:33,819 --> 01:16:34,960
another

1286
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,640
and the deleterious commented that the
governor reagan has made about

1287
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,539
unemployment compensation

1288
01:16:40,539 --> 01:16:43,908
these commitments at the Democratic
Party has historically made to the

1289
01:16:43,908 --> 01:16:46,349
working families have this nation

1290
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:49,650
have been extremely important to the
growth

1291
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:54,079
in their stature and in a better quality
of life for them

1292
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,399
I noticed recently that governor reagan
prequel a quote

1293
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,029
Democratic president in his acceptance
address another what I have never heard

1294
01:17:03,029 --> 01:17:06,329
a candidate for president who is a
republican

1295
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:10,329
quote a Republican president but when I
get an official

1296
01:17:10,329 --> 01:17:13,899
they try to govern like republicans so
it's good for the american people to

1297
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:15,460
remember there's a sharp

1298
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:19,300
basic historical different between
governor reagan me on these crucial

1299
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:19,969
issues

1300
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:23,090
also between the two parties that we
represent thank you mister president

1301
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:26,469
governor reagan we now go to another
question

1302
01:17:26,469 --> 01:17:29,810
question to president carter by Barbara
Walters

1303
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:34,659
from them you have addressed summer the
major issues tonight but the biggest

1304
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:38,420
issue in the mind american voters is USA
homes

1305
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:42,149
your ability to lead this country many
voters go into

1306
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:45,569
that move just a week from today they
will be voting their got

1307
01:17:45,569 --> 01:17:51,329
instant about you man here already given
as your reasons why people should vote

1308
01:17:51,329 --> 01:17:55,550
for you now would you please tell us for
this your final question why they should

1309
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,380
not vote for your opponent

1310
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:00,609
why his presidency could be harmful to
the nation

1311
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:04,939
and have been examine both your
opponent's record and the man himself

1312
01:18:04,939 --> 01:18:08,069
tell us his greatest weakness

1313
01:18:08,069 --> 01:18:11,170
by reluctant as I am sending critical
about governor reagan I'll try to answer

1314
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:17,100
your question

1315
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:21,150
first of all is a historical perspective
that i just described

1316
01:18:21,149 --> 01:18:26,158
this is a contest between a Democrat in
a mainstream love my party

1317
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:30,549
as exemplified by the actions that have
taken an oval office last four years

1318
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:34,570
as contrasted with governor reagan who
in most cases

1319
01:18:34,569 --> 01:18:38,019
does typify his pro day but in some
cases

1320
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:42,159
there's a radical departure by him from
the Heritage

1321
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:45,889
all eyes an hour and others

1322
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:49,329
the most important crucial difference in
this election campaign in my judgment is

1323
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:51,329
the approach to the control

1324
01:18:51,329 --> 01:18:54,359
up nuclear weaponry and the

1325
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:58,238
inclination to control or not to control
the spread

1326
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:02,198
atomic weapons to other nations I don't
present have a particular terrorist

1327
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:03,689
nations

1328
01:19:03,689 --> 01:19:07,169
the incarnation the governor reagan his
example find

1329
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:13,239
in May troubled times since he's been
running for president I think since 1968

1330
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:17,229
to inject American military forces in
places like north korea

1331
01:19:17,229 --> 01:19:21,019
to put a blockade around cuba this year
all

1332
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:25,010
in some instances to project american
forces into

1333
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:29,480
a fishing dispute against all the small
nation a backward or

1334
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:32,919
on the west coast of South America this

1335
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,770
is typical of his long-standing

1336
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:40,780
incarnation on the use of

1337
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:46,639
American power-law not to resolve
disputes diplomatically and peacefully

1338
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,260
but the show that they exercise at
military power

1339
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:56,579
is best proven by the actual use of it

1340
01:19:56,579 --> 01:20:00,000
obviously no president want war

1341
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,819
and I certainly do not believe the
governor again if he were president

1342
01:20:02,819 --> 01:20:04,988
would walk wall

1343
01:20:04,988 --> 01:20:09,329
but a president in the Oval Office has
to make a judgment

1344
01:20:09,329 --> 01:20:13,229
on almost a daily basis about how to
exercise enormous power country

1345
01:20:13,229 --> 01:20:16,329
for peace through diplomacy all

1346
01:20:16,329 --> 01:20:19,769
in a curious way in a belligerent at
attitude

1347
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,989
which has example but his attitude

1348
01:20:22,988 --> 01:20:26,549
in the past blogger would you repeat the
question for governor again

1349
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:30,550
from 10 realizing that you may be
equally reluctant to speak you love your

1350
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:32,079
opponent mad

1351
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,500
why people should not vote your opponent

1352
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:39,300
why his presidency could be harmful to
the nation

1353
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:43,210
and having examined both your opponent's
record and the man himself

1354
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:46,239
could you tell us his greatest weekend

1355
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:49,629
Barbara I believe that there is a
fundamental difference and I think it

1356
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:51,550
has been evident in most to the answers
that

1357
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:56,429
mister carter's given tonight that he
seeks the solution to anything

1358
01:20:56,429 --> 01:21:00,239
as another opportunity for a federal
government program

1359
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:03,250
I happen to believe that the federal
government has usurped the powers and

1360
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:04,050
don't wanna many

1361
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:07,610
autonomy in authority to belongs back at
the state and local level

1362
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:11,609
it has imposed on the individual freedom
to the people and that there are more of

1363
01:21:11,609 --> 01:21:15,279
these things that could be solved by the
people themselves

1364
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,500
if they were given a chance or by the
levels of government that were closer to

1365
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,969
them

1366
01:21:19,969 --> 01:21:24,119
now as to why I should be and he
shouldn't be

1367
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:27,969
when he was a candidate 1976 President
Carter

1368
01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:31,219
invented I think he called the misery
index

1369
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:35,179
he added the rate of unemployment and
the rated inflation

1370
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:38,279
and it came at that time to 20.5

1371
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:43,609
under president ford any said that no
man with that size mens rea index

1372
01:21:43,609 --> 01:21:47,189
had a right to seek reelection to the
presidency

1373
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:50,649
today by his own decision

1374
01:21:50,649 --> 01:21:53,719
leave misery index is an excess

1375
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:57,560
up 20 percent and I think this must
suggest

1376
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:01,039
something but im

1377
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:04,719
when I have quoted a democrat president
is the president says

1378
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:09,948
I was a democrat I said many foolish
things back in those days

1379
01:22:09,948 --> 01:22:13,779
but the president that I quoted had made
a promise

1380
01:22:13,779 --> 01:22:17,149
a democrat prompts and I quoted him
because

1381
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:20,299
it was never kept and today

1382
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:24,340
you would find that that promise is at
the very heart

1383
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,810
what republicanism represents in this
country today

1384
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:30,420
and that's why I believe they're going
to be millions have democrats that are

1385
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,310
going to vote with

1386
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:35,780
past this time around because they too
want that promise kept

1387
01:22:35,779 --> 01:22:39,488
it was a promise for less government and
less taxes

1388
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:43,569
and more freedom for the people
president carter

1389
01:22:43,569 --> 01:22:46,639
yes I mention the

1390
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:50,989
radical departure of governor reagan
from their principles or ideals

1391
01:22:50,988 --> 01:22:54,619
a historical perspective on his own
party I don't like this can be better

1392
01:22:54,619 --> 01:22:55,670
illustrated than

1393
01:22:55,670 --> 01:23:00,270
in the case with guaranteeing women
people rights under the Constitution

1394
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:01,400
about nation

1395
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:05,420
for forty years the republican party
platforms

1396
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:08,929
call poor guaranteeing women equal
rights

1397
01:23:08,929 --> 01:23:13,319
with a constitutional amendment 6
predecessors have man who served in the

1398
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:16,789
oval office call for this guarantee a
women's rights

1399
01:23:16,789 --> 01:23:22,170
governor reagan and that new Republican
Party has departed from this commitment

1400
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:26,119
a very severe blow to the opportunity
for women find it to correct

1401
01:23:26,119 --> 01:23:29,609
discrimination under which they have
suffered

1402
01:23:29,609 --> 01:23:33,779
when a man and a woman to the same
amount to work a man gets paid a dollar

1403
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:38,889
a woman only get paid $15 and sent and
the equal rights amendment on Ascension

1404
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:42,730
that equality albright's shall not be
abridged

1405
01:23:42,729 --> 01:23:46,928
for women by the federal government all
by the state government

1406
01:23:46,929 --> 01:23:51,550
that's all it surged a sub or guarantee
of equality of opportunity

1407
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:56,039
which typifies the Democratic Party and
which is a very important commitment of

1408
01:23:56,039 --> 01:23:57,050
mine

1409
01:23:57,050 --> 01:24:01,060
as contrasted with governor reagan's
radical departure from

1410
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:04,380
the long-standing policy of his own
party

1411
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:07,520
governor reagan yes

1412
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,800
its president once again I happen to be
against the amendment

1413
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:15,369
because I think the amendment will take
this problem out of the hands of elected

1414
01:24:15,369 --> 01:24:18,399
legislators and put my hands when I like
the judges

1415
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:23,349
I am for equal rights and while you have
been in office for four years and not

1416
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,860
one single state

1417
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:28,000
and most of them have a majority of
Democratic legislators

1418
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,590
has added to the ratification or voted
to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment

1419
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:35,840
while I was governor more than eight
years ago

1420
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,980
I found fourteen separate instances
where women were discriminated against

1421
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:42,149
in the body of california law

1422
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:46,899
and I had passed and signed into law 14
statutes that eliminated

1423
01:24:46,899 --> 01:24:50,738
those discriminations including the
economic ones that you have just

1424
01:24:50,738 --> 01:24:53,279
mentioned equal pay and so forth

1425
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:56,779
I believe that if we're all these years
that we've spent trying to get the

1426
01:24:56,779 --> 01:24:57,819
amendment

1427
01:24:57,819 --> 01:25:02,420
we spend as much time correcting these
laws as we did in california and we were

1428
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:03,619
the first to do it

1429
01:25:03,619 --> 01:25:08,170
if I were president I would also now
take a look at the hundreds

1430
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:12,520
I love federal regulations which
discriminate against women

1431
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,670
and which mall right on well everyone is
looking for an amendment

1432
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:20,050
I would have someone ride herd on those
regulations

1433
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:22,889
and which start eliminating those
discriminations in the federal

1434
01:25:22,889 --> 01:25:24,789
government against women

1435
01:25:24,789 --> 01:25:28,729
president current how I'm a southern

1436
01:25:28,729 --> 01:25:33,629
and I share the basic beliefs have my
region about

1437
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:37,250
an excessive government intrusion into
the private affairs American citizens

1438
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,010
and also into the private affairs

1439
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:42,789
the free enterprise system one other
commitment that I may wish to deregulate

1440
01:25:42,789 --> 01:25:44,000
the major industries

1441
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,029
%uh this country we've been remarkably
successful with the help of the

1442
01:25:47,029 --> 01:25:48,319
democratic congress

1443
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:52,319
we deregulate the air industry the rail
industry the trucking industry financial

1444
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:53,488
institutions

1445
01:25:53,488 --> 01:25:57,119
now working on the communications
industry an additional and

1446
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:00,130
I believe this element of discrimination

1447
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:04,079
is something that I South has scene so
vividly

1448
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:07,908
as a blight oh no region of the country
which has now been corrected

1449
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:10,908
not only racial discrimination but
discrimination against people have to

1450
01:26:10,908 --> 01:26:12,259
work for a living

1451
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:16,239
because we have been trying to pick
ourselves up but bootstraps

1452
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:20,149
sent the long depression years

1453
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:23,719
and lead appalled and useful life in the
affairs of this country we made

1454
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:25,100
remarkable success

1455
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:29,179
is part of my consciousness and my
commitment to continue this progress

1456
01:26:29,179 --> 01:26:33,350
so my heritage as a southerner my
experience in the Oval Office

1457
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:36,949
convinces me that what I just described
as a proper course for the future

1458
01:26:36,948 --> 01:26:41,539
governor reagan yours is the last word
well my last word is again to save with

1459
01:26:41,539 --> 01:26:42,369
this

1460
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:46,000
we were talking about this very simple
amendment in women's rights

1461
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,988
I'm a good plan again I am for women's
rights but I would like to call

1462
01:26:49,988 --> 01:26:54,638
the tension people to the fact that a
step show called simple amendment

1463
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:59,520
could be used by mister his men to
destroy discriminations that properly

1464
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,130
belong by law to women

1465
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,579
respecting the physical differences
between the two sexes

1466
01:27:05,579 --> 01:27:09,149
labor laws that protect them against
doing things that would be physically

1467
01:27:09,149 --> 01:27:10,589
harmful to them

1468
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:14,600
those were all could all be challenged
my men

1469
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:18,310
and the same would be true with regard
to combat service in the military and so

1470
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:19,199
forth

1471
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:22,658
I thought there was a subject we were
supposed to be on but if we're talking

1472
01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:23,719
about

1473
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:27,489
how much we think about the working
people and so forth I'm the only further

1474
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,279
than ever ran for this job

1475
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:33,000
who was six times president of his own
Union and still is a lifetime membership

1476
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,300
in that union

1477
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,969
gentleman need to you now have three
minutes for

1478
01:27:38,969 --> 01:27:43,460
a closing statement president carter
your first

1479
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:46,829
first to like to thank the label League
of Women Voters for making this

1480
01:27:46,829 --> 01:27:50,689
debate possible I think it's been a very
constructive debate

1481
01:27:50,689 --> 01:27:54,009
and I hope it helped to quite the
American people with a sharp differences

1482
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:56,389
between myself and governor reagan

1483
01:27:56,389 --> 01:28:00,710
also want to thank the people Cleveland
and Ohio be in touch hospitable host

1484
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:04,929
during this last few hours in my life

1485
01:28:04,929 --> 01:28:08,600
have been present now for

1486
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,639
almost four years I had to make 1000

1487
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:17,489
a decision and each one of those
decisions has been a learning process

1488
01:28:17,488 --> 01:28:21,428
i've seen the strength my nation and
i've seen the crises that it approached

1489
01:28:21,429 --> 01:28:22,929
inattentive way

1490
01:28:22,929 --> 01:28:26,859
and I've had to deal with those crises
as best I could

1491
01:28:26,859 --> 01:28:30,509
as I've said the record between myself
and governor reagan

1492
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:34,869
I've been impressed with the stark
differences that exist between

1493
01:28:34,869 --> 01:28:38,840
I think the result of this debate
indicate but that fact is true

1494
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,940
I consider myself in the mainstream of
my party I consider myself an amine

1495
01:28:42,939 --> 01:28:46,658
mainstream even up the bipartisan

1496
01:28:46,658 --> 01:28:50,969
list to president who served before me

1497
01:28:50,969 --> 01:28:54,329
the United States must be

1498
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:58,369
a nation strong the United States must
be a nation

1499
01:28:58,369 --> 01:29:01,689
secure we must have a society this just

1500
01:29:01,689 --> 01:29:06,210
and play a and we must extend the
benefit of our own commitment to peace

1501
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:10,039
to create a peaceful world

1502
01:29:10,039 --> 01:29:14,210
I believe that since I've been in office
they've been 608

1503
01:29:14,210 --> 01:29:19,429
areas of combat evolved in other parts
of the world

1504
01:29:19,429 --> 01:29:25,039
in each cage I alone have had to
determine the interest of my country

1505
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:28,500
and the degree of involvement my country

1506
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,819
I've done that but moderation with care
with thoughtfulness

1507
01:29:32,819 --> 01:29:35,948
sometimes consulting expert but I've
learned

1508
01:29:35,948 --> 01:29:40,789
in his last three and a half years that
went issue is extremely difficult

1509
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:45,060
when the call is very close the chances
are the experts will be divided almost

1510
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,400
50-50

1511
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:49,769
in the final judgment about the future a
nation

1512
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:53,520
war PC involvement reticence

1513
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,940
thoughtfulness care consideration
concerned

1514
01:29:56,939 --> 01:30:00,319
has to be made by the man in the Oval
Office

1515
01:30:00,319 --> 01:30:04,090
let alone a job but with involving to
the american people in the process with

1516
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,449
an open government

1517
01:30:05,448 --> 01:30:10,089
the job is a very gratifying one the
American people now facing

1518
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:13,810
next tuesday a lonely decision

1519
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:16,550
those listening to my boys will have to
make a judgment about the future this

1520
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:17,840
country

1521
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:21,139
and I think they'll remember that one
bow to make a lot of different

1522
01:30:21,139 --> 01:30:25,650
if one vote per precinct had changed in
1960 John Kennedy would never have been

1523
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:26,469
president

1524
01:30:26,469 --> 01:30:31,310
this nation have a few more people had
gone to the polls and voted in 1968

1525
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:35,280
hubert humphrey would have been
president richard nixon would not

1526
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:39,539
there is a partnership involving in our
nation to stay strong

1527
01:30:39,539 --> 01:30:43,019
to stay at peace the Rays had a ban on
human rights

1528
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,560
to set an example for the rest of the
world to let ID beliefs and commitments

1529
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,190
be fell about others

1530
01:30:48,189 --> 01:30:51,349
in all the nations is my plan for the
future

1531
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:54,690
I S American people to join me in this
partition

1532
01:30:54,689 --> 01:30:58,678
governor reagan because I would like to
have my words of thanks

1533
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:02,520
to to the ladies have the the League of
Women Voters

1534
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,440
making these debates possible I'm sorry
that

1535
01:31:06,439 --> 01:31:09,729
we couldn't persuade the

1536
01:31:09,729 --> 01:31:13,218
bringing into the third candidate so
that he could have been seen also in

1537
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:14,289
these debates

1538
01:31:14,289 --> 01:31:18,929
but still it's good that at least once
all three of us were heard by the people

1539
01:31:18,929 --> 01:31:20,960
in this country

1540
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:26,420
next tuesday is election day next
tuesday olive you will go to the polls

1541
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:31,260
you stand there in the polling place
make a decision

1542
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:35,780
I think when you make that decision it
might be well if you would ask yourself

1543
01:31:35,779 --> 01:31:40,948
are you better off than you were four
years ago

1544
01:31:40,948 --> 01:31:44,319
is it easier for you to go and buy
things in the stores and was four years

1545
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:46,198
ago

1546
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:49,279
is there more or less unemployment in
the country

1547
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:53,319
and there was four years ago is america

1548
01:31:53,319 --> 01:31:56,460
has respected throughout the world as it
was

1549
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:59,789
do you feel that our security is

1550
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:03,439
as safe but we're a strong as we were
four years ago

1551
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:07,049
and if you answer all those questions
yes why then I think your choice is very

1552
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:08,170
obvious

1553
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:12,940
do you vote for if you don't agree

1554
01:32:12,939 --> 01:32:16,948
if you don't think that this course that
we've been on for the last four years is

1555
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:20,500
what you would like to see us follow
over the next four

1556
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:25,649
then I could suggest another choice that
you have

1557
01:32:25,649 --> 01:32:29,029
this country doesn't have to be

1558
01:32:29,029 --> 01:32:33,488
in the shape that it is in we do not
have to go down go on

1559
01:32:33,488 --> 01:32:38,519
sharing and scarcity with the country
getting worse off

1560
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:43,350
with unemployment growing we talk about
the unemployment lines

1561
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:47,480
he followed the unemployed today we were
in a single line allowing two feet

1562
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:50,689
breach 10 the midline would reach from
New York City to Los Angeles

1563
01:32:50,689 --> 01:32:52,448
californians

1564
01:32:52,448 --> 01:32:56,079
although this can be cured and all that
can be solved

1565
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:00,448
I have not had the experience to the
president as head in holding that office

1566
01:33:00,448 --> 01:33:03,529
but I think in being governor of
California the most populous state in

1567
01:33:03,529 --> 01:33:05,529
the Union

1568
01:33:05,529 --> 01:33:08,559
if it were a nation that would be the
seventh ranking economic power in the

1569
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,820
world

1570
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:13,369
I too had some only moments and
decisions to make

1571
01:33:13,369 --> 01:33:17,800
I know that the economic program that I
have proposed for this nation

1572
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,989
in the next few years can resolve many
other problems the trouble is today

1573
01:33:22,988 --> 01:33:26,189
I know because we did their

1574
01:33:26,189 --> 01:33:29,488
week %uh the cost the increased cost of
government

1575
01:33:29,488 --> 01:33:35,178
the increase in half over the eight
years we returned 5.7 billion dollars

1576
01:33:35,179 --> 01:33:38,920
in tax rebates credits and cuts to our
people

1577
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:43,389
we as I said earlier fell below the
national average in

1578
01:33:43,389 --> 01:33:47,310
inflation when we did that and I know
that

1579
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:50,989
we didn't give back authority and
autonomy to the people

1580
01:33:50,988 --> 01:33:55,638
I would like to have a crusade today and
I would like to lead the crusade with

1581
01:33:55,639 --> 01:33:56,250
your help

1582
01:33:56,250 --> 01:34:00,189
and it would be one to take government
off the backs of the great people of

1583
01:34:00,189 --> 01:34:01,678
this country

1584
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:04,779
and turn you loose again to do those
things that I know

1585
01:34:04,779 --> 01:34:10,109
you can do so well because you did the
man made this country great

1586
01:34:10,109 --> 01:34:14,839
thank you gentleman ladies and gentleman
for sixty years the League of Women

1587
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:18,400
Voters has been committed to citizen
education and the effective

1588
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:19,599
participation

1589
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,650
Americans in governmental in political
affairs

1590
01:34:22,649 --> 01:34:26,929
the most critical element at all in that
process is an informed citizen who goes

1591
01:34:26,929 --> 01:34:29,149
to the polls on Google Maps

1592
01:34:29,149 --> 01:34:33,379
on badly wound motors now I would like
to thank President Carter

1593
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:34,069
and governor reagan
